<h1>Geometric Physics Project Overview</h1>

<p>The purpose of this website is to research and prototype content, presentation, interactivity and pedagogy for a Next Generation Geometric Physics Learning Environment. It is, by no means, a complete curriculum resource!</p>

  <h3>Geometry as Motivating Principle</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Nature's Laws tends to be simplest when expressed in terms of geometric quantities.</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Is it possible to reformulate physics curriculum to take advantage of this new perspective?

  <h3>Modeling-based and Inquiry-based Pedagogy as Best Practices</h3>
  <p>
    Physics Education Research shows that the traditional cycle of lecture followed by experimental validation and problems is not effective for the majority of beginning physics students. Furthermore, a modeling-based approach has been shown to be more effective.
  </p>
  <p>
    This suggests that if technology is used as a tool for teaching physics then it must at least have the kinds of features that are present in a modeling-based course with an expert instructor.

<h3>Geometric Physics Manifesto</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Expose the mathematical unity that is obscured by traditional vector analysis.</li>
  <li>Leverage geometric visualization of duality.</li>
  <li>Provide a consolidation of Geometric Algebra/Calculus and Differential Forms/Geometry.</li>
  <li>Pave the way to Maxwell, Gravitation and Quantum Mechanics.</li>
  <li>Don't dumb down the Math; make it accessible instead.</li>
  <li>Don't push facts and memorization. Derive theorems, even if limited in scope.</li>
  <li>Geometric Algebra as the Mathematical Language foundation.</li>
  <li>Calculus is essential.</li>
  <li>Motivate by realistic examples and challenging problems.</li>
  <li>Videos for explaining difficult concepts.</li>
  <li>Modeling-based instruction</li>
  <li>Programming to understand mathematical operations, function types and phenomena.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<p>
  I am researching web-based technologies to create interactive physics content. If that works out well enough, the next step will be to personalize the experience for a student. It may also take quite a bit of (dare I say it?) Artificial Intelligence to arrive at something that can rival, exceed, or compliment the modeling-based and inquiry-based approaches to pedagogy that have been validated by physics education research.
