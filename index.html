<h1>Geometric Physics Manifesto</h1>

<p>The purpose of this website is to research content for a Next Generation Physics Curriculum.</p>
<p>Principles</p>
<ul>
  <li>Expose the mathematical unity that is obscured by vector analysis.</li>
  <li>Leverage geometric visualization of duality.</li>
  <li>Provide a consolidation of Geometric Algebra/Calculus and Differential Forms/Geometry.</li>
  <li>Pave the way to Maxwell, Gravitation and Quantum Mechanics.</li>
  <li>Don't dumb down the Math; make it accessible instead.</li>
  <li>Don't push facts and memorization. Derive theorems, even if limited in scope.</li>
  <li>Geometric Algebra as the Mathematical Language foundation.</li>
  <li>Calculus is essential.</li>
  <li>Motivate by realistic examples and challenging problems.</li>
  <li>Videos for explaining difficult concepts.</li>
  <li>Modeling-based instruction</li>
  <li>Programming to understand mathematical operations, function types and phenomena.</li>
</ul>
