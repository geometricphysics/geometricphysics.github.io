<h1>Geometric Physics</h1>

<p>The purpose of this website is to prototype content for a Next Generation Physics Curriculum.</p>
<p>Principles</p>
<ul>
  <li>Don't dumb down the Math; make it accessible instead.</li>
  <li>Don't push facts and memorization. Derive theorems, even if limited in scope.</li>
  <li>Geometric Algebra as the Mathematical Language foundation.</li>
  <li>Calculus is essential. Ease into it early on.</li>
  <li>Motivate by realistic examples and challenging problems.</li>
  <li>Videos for explaining difficult concepts.</li>
  <li>Modeling</li>
  <li>Programming to understand mathematical operations, function types and phenomena.</li>
</ul>
