    <h3>Nature of Science (NOS)</h3>

      The following bullets are from Keys to Teaching the Nature of Science, with my brief comments.

              Science demands and relies on empirical evidence.
            </b>
            We don't use postulates that are incosequential.

            <b>
              Knowledge production in science includes many common features and shared habits of mind. However, in spite of such common features there is no single step-by-step scientific method by which all science is done.
            </b>
            Presentation is not the same as process.
          </p>

            <b>
              Scientific knowledge is tentative but durable. This means that science cannot prove anything because the problem of induction makes "proof" impossible, but scientific conclusions are still valuable and long lasting because of the way that knowledge eventually comes to be accepted in science.
            </b>
            We cannot gather an infinite number of data points in all domains.
          <p>

        <li>
          <p>
            <b>
              Laws and theories are related but distinct kinds of scientific knowledge.
            </b>
            I don't find this very useful. I think the words <b>postulate</b> and <b>theory</b> are clearer and the word <b>law</b> may correspond to a postulate or a fact derived from postulates using a theory.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            <b>
              Science is a highly creative endeavor.

          <p>
            <b>
              Science has a subjective element.
            </b>
            The process of discovery may be subjective bit the conclusions should be more objective.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>
              There are historical, cultural, and social influences on science.

              Science and technology impact each other, but they are not the same.

        <li>
          <p>
            <b>
              Science and its methods cannot answer all questions.
            </b>
            But I disagree with the idea that science has nothing to say about morality, ethics and faith.

    <h3>Five Easy Lessons</h3>

              Keep students actively engaged and provide rapid feedback.

        <li>
          <p>
            <b>
              Focus on phenomena rather than abstractions.
            </b>
            Good for learning, but inducting abstractions is a key idea in physics.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>
              Deal explicitly with students alternative conceptions.

              Teach and use explicit problem-solving skills and strategies.

        <li>
          <p>
            <b>
              Write homework and exam problems that go beyond symbol manipulation to engage students in the qualitative and conceptual analysis of physical phenomena.

    <h3>How to Solve Physics Problems</h3>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Draw as many diagrams of the situation described in the problem statement as are necessary to make the situation and your analysis clear. Often, one will suffice. On your diagrams, use symbols not values. Near the diagram, draw up a table of the givens, being sure to respect the precision and units given in the problem statement.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Read the entire question or problem as many times as necessary to be confident that you now precisely what is being asked in each section. Make a mental note whether the same intermediate quantity will figure in several calculations. If not, numerical values should only be substituted into completely derived algebraic expressions for the requested quantities.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In force problems, isolate the appropriate components of the system and sketch a force diagram for them. Put a coordinate system on each diagram. Deduce the appropriate equations of motion. In other problems, cite the appropriate laws and relations, and justify the equations you deduce where necessary. Be certain that all symbols you use have been defined, either by context or explicitly.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Complete the algebra using symbols; outline your formula. If no values have been provided, check your formula using dimensional analysis. If values have been provided, substitute them into the formula, being sure to respect their precision and units. Compute the requested value. Round your answer to the precision of the least precise given value upon which your result depends. In cases where a given is written as 800 km, for example, use 1, 2, or 3 significant figures based on the precision of the other given values. Be sure that the units work out. Outline the final (rounded) answer written in appropriate units. An answer of 1.0 x 107 s should often be converted to 120 days or 3.8 months to make the answer more meaningful or useful. In subsequent calculations, use unrounded values and round at the end. Most importantly, ask yourself, "Does the answer make sense?"
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Look at your answers and ask if they make physical sense. If they don't, go back over the calculation. Check the formula to be sure that it displays the appropriate dependencies on the givens. Should the velocity increase or decrease with time? As  goes to zero or /2, does your formula simplify properly? etc. Finally and most importantly, ask yourself what you have learned.
