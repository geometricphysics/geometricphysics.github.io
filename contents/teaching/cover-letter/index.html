      I am incredibly excited to be applying for the position of Upper School Physics teacher at Cary Academy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As my understanding of Cary Academy has expanded through this process, I have come to appreciate what a truly unique and valuable educational institution we are fortunate to have in this area. I am particulary impressed by the progressive and flexible nature of the curriculum, the excitement and mature attitude of the students, and the clear commitment of the staff.

      Cary Academy obviously cares about developing each student to their maximum potential and this shows in the innovative, sometimes technological, approaches to instruction, time allocated to exploration, and the diversity of extra-curriclular activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have also discovered that I have had the pleasure of knowing both a member of the teaching staff and a successful student from Cary Academy and it makes me proud to be associated with these people who do credit to the institution and themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would like nothing more than to serve the students and be part of the exploration of innovative ways to mentor future generations of physicists.
