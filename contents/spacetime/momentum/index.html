    <h3>Mass</h3>
    <p>
      We will use a very restricted argument to deduce the dependence of the inertial mass on the relative velocity. Using the result as a conjecture, we proceed to find a more general derivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider a glancing collision between a sphere at rest in Alice's frame and a sphere at rest in Bob's frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      We make the collision glancing so that the transverse velocity imparted to each sphere is very small compared to the relative velocity $v$ of the two inertial frames.
    </p>
    <p>
      By symmetry, the spheres will have equal and opposite transverse velocities in their respective frames of magnitude $u_{\perp}$.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems fashionable these days to assume that mass means rest mass and so we indicate the rest mass by $m$.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose that the mass of the moving sphere, $m(v)$ is a function of it's rest value $m$ as a result of the relative speed of the two frames. By conservation of the transverse momentum we have
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      m u_{\perp} &amp; = &amp; \frac{m(v) u_{\perp}}{\gamma(v)(1 \pm v \, u_{\perp})},
      \end{eqnarray}
      $ where the choice of sign depends whether the collision is being examined from Alice or Bob's frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering the limit of an increasingly glancing blow so that $v \, u_{\perp} \ll 1$, we obtain
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      m(v) &amp; = &amp; \gamma(v) m
      \end{eqnarray}
      $

    <h3>Momentum</h3>
    <p>
      We can derive an expression for the four-momentum using the four-velocity:
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      P &amp; = &amp; m \, U = \gamma(u) (m \Vector{u}, m) = (\Vector{p}, \gamma(u) \, m)
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      This construction of another four-vector requires only that $m$ is a scalar.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be used to recover the Energy-momentum transformation using the standard LT as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \Primed{p}_x &amp; = &amp; \gamma(v) (p_x - v \, \gamma(u) \, m) \\
      \Primed{p}_y &amp; = &amp; p_y \\
      \Primed{p}_z &amp; = &amp; p_z \\
      \gamma(\Primed{u}) \Primed{m} &amp; = &amp; \gamma(v) (\gamma(u) m - v \, p_x) \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
