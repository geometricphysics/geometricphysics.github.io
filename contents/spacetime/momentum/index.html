  <h1>Momentum and Mass</h1>
  <section>
    <h3>Mass</h3>
    <p>
      We will use a very restricted argument to deduce the dependence of the inertial mass on the relative velocity. Using the result as a conjecture, we proceed to find a more general derivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider a glancing collision between a sphere at rest in Alice's frame and a sphere at rest in Bob's frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      We make the collision glancing so that the transverse velocity imparted to each sphere is very small compared to the relative velocity $v$ of the two inertial frames.
    </p>
    <p>
      By symmetry, the spheres will have equal and opposite transverse velocities in their respective frames of magnitude $u_{\perp}$.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose that the mass of the moving sphere, $m(v)$ is a function of it's rest value $m$ as a result of the relative speed of the two frames. By conservation of the transverse momentum we have
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      m u_{\perp} &amp; = &amp; \frac{m(v) u_{\perp}}{\gamma(v)(1 \pm v \, u_{\perp})},
      \end{eqnarray}
      $ where the choice of sign depends whether the collision is being examined from Alice or Bob's frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering the limit of an increasingly glancing blow so that $v \, u_{\perp} \ll 1$, we obtain
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      m(v) &amp; = &amp; \gamma(v) m
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>

    <h3>Momentum</h3>
    <p>
      We can derive an expression for the four-momentum using the four-velocity:
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      P &amp; = &amp; m \, U = \gamma(u) (m, m \Vector{u}) = (E, \Vector{p})
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      This construction of another four-vector requires only that $m$ is a scalar.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be used to recover the Energy-momentum transformation using the standard LT as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \Primed{p}_x &amp; = &amp; \gamma(v) (p_x - v \, \gamma(u) \, m) \\
      \Primed{p}_y &amp; = &amp; p_y \\
      \Primed{p}_z &amp; = &amp; p_z \\
      \gamma(\Primed{u}) \Primed{m} &amp; = &amp; \gamma(v) (\gamma(u) m - v \, p_x) \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>

    <h3>Energy Conservation</h3>
    <p>
      Consider a collision between two particles. Momentum conservation gives us that
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \Vector{p}_1 + \Vector{p}_2 &amp; = &amp; \Vector{p}_3 + \Vector{p}_4
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Construct the four-vector
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      P_1 + P_2 - P_3 - P_4 &amp; = &amp; 0
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      If momentum is conserved in all frames then this four-vector must be the zero vector. This is the <em>zero component theorem</em> which can be proved by knowing that rotations mix space components and boosts mix space and time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It follows that we must have energy conservation (the time components) with $E = \gamma(u) \, m \, c^2$.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also have the scalar invariant $E^2 - (\Vector{p} c)^2 = m^2 c^4$.

    <h3>Energy and Velocity from 4-Momentum</h3>
    <p>
      Consider a particle of rest mass $m$ and 4-momentum $P = (E(\Vector{v}), \Vector{p}) = \gamma(\Vector{v})m(1,\Vector{v})$. The observer has a 4-velocity $U = \gamma(\Vector{u})(1, \Vector{u})$. Using the metric $(+1,-1,-1,-1)$, we find the following invariants
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      U \cdot U &amp; = &amp; 1
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      P \cdot P &amp; = &amp; E^2 - (\Vector{p})^2 = m^2
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
      (by going to rest frame of particle)
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      U \cdot P &amp; = &amp; m \gamma(\Vector{u}) \gamma(\Vector{v}) (1 - \Vector{u} \cdot \Vector{v}) = E(\Vector{v})
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
      (by going to the observer frame) where $E(\Vector{v})$ is the energy of the particle as measured by the observer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnitude of the particle momentum measured by the observer is 
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \Norm{\Vector{p}} &amp; = &amp; [E^2 - P \cdot P]^\frac{1}{2} = [(U \cdot P)^2 - P \cdot P]^\frac{1}{2}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      The ordinary velocity is related to the ordinary momentum
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \Vector{p} &amp; = &amp; \gamma(\Vector{v}) m \Vector{v} = E(\Vector{v}) \Vector{v}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      There exists a 4-velocity $V$ in which the components measured by the observer are $(0, \Vector{v})$
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \frac{P}{P \cdot U} - U &amp; = &amp; (1, \Vector{v}) - (1, \Vector{0}) = (0, \Vector{v})
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
