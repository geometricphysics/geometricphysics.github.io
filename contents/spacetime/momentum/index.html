    <h3>Mass</h3>
    <p>
      We will use a very restricted argument to deduce the dependence of the inertial mass on the relative velocity. Using the result as a conjecture, we proceed to find a more general derivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider a glancing collision between a sphere at rest in Alice's frame and a sphere at rest in Bob's frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      We make the collision glancing so that the transverse velocity imparted to each sphere is very small compared to the relative velocity $v$ of the two inertial frames.
    </p>
    <p>
      By symmetry, the spheres will have equal and opposite transverse velocities in their respective frames of magnitude $u_{\perp}$.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose that the mass of the moving sphere, $m$ is a function of it's rest value $m_0$ as a result of the relative speed of the two frames. By conservation of the transverse momentum we have
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      m_0 u_{\perp} &amp; = &amp; \frac{m u_{\perp}}{\gamma(v)(1 \pm v \, u_{\perp})}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $, where the choice of sign depends whether the collision is being examined from Alice or Bob's frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering the limit of an increasingly glancing blow so that $v \, u_{\perp} \ll 1$, we obtain
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      m &amp; = &amp; \gamma(v) m_0
      \end{eqnarray}
      $.
