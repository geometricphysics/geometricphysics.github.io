  <h1>Clocks</h1>
  <section>
    <h3>Clock Definition</h3>
    <p>
      A clock is a physical device for recording the occurrence of an event at the position of the clock as a number.
    </p>
    <p>
      The output of the clock is a list of numbers, one for each event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless the clock is reset, the list of numbers increases monotonically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number recorded is called the time of the event according to the clock at the position of the event.

    <h3>Clock Implementation</h3>
    <p>
      A clock is realized by forcing a naturally occurring damped oscillator to resonate with a macroscopic frequency source by tuning the frequency source to deliver maximum amplitude. A counter is then used against the macroscopic frequency source.

    <h3>Good Clock</h3>
    <p>
      A good clock is one that when compared to other clocks, in the limit of zero separation, records the same interval between events.

    <h3>Clock Hypothesis (Ideal Clock Definition)</h3>
    <p>
      The rate of an ideal clock moving relative to an inertial frame depends only upon its instantaneous speed relative to the inertial frame.

    <h3>Commentary</h3>
    <p>
      This definition of a clock includes that act of measurement so that a clock is a complete device for measuring the time of events. It's not good enough to say that a pendulum is a clock; we must include the observer who is counting the pendulim swings and correlating the number of swings to events in the neighborhood.
