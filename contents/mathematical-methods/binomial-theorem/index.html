    <h3>Statement of the theorem</h3>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      (x+y)^{n} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} x^{k} y^{n-k}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $

    <h3>Combinatorial Proof (Integer index)</h3>
    <p>
      Consider the strings of $x$'s and $y$'s. By the distributive law, each string will be length $n$. There will also be $n$ such strings. Those strings containing $k$ occurrences of $x$ will contain $n-k$ occurrences of $y$. Assuming that multiplication of $x$ and $y$ is commutative, rearrange each term to put the $x$'s at the left and the $y$'s to the right. Consider the terms of the form $x^{k} y^{n-k}$. The number of such terms is $_{n} C _{k}$.

    <h3>Extension to Rational, Real and Complex index</h3>
    <p>
      Extension requires Calculus. Maclaurin series.
