  <section>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Suppose that we have a function $f(x)$ with derivatives of all orders in some neighborhood containing the point $x = a$, then, at any point in the neighborhood, the function can be represented by a series in powers of $x-a$.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(x-a)^{n}}{n!} f^{(n)}(a)
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>

    <h3>Derivation</h3>
    <p>
      One approach is to assume that an infinite series expansion for $f(x)$ exists and then to compute the coefficients.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      f(x) = a_{0} + a_{1} (x-a) + a_{2} (x-a)^{2} + \cdots + a_{r} (x-a)^{r} + \cdots
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      By differentiating, and setting $x=a$ each time, we can show
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      a_{r} = \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this approach does not give us much insight into the error caused by truncating the series.
