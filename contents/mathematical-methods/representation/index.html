    <h3>Big Ideas</h3>

      The central theory of group representations is the <b>Great Orthogonality Theorem</b>.

    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A <b>representation</b> of a group is a collection of square non-singular matrices associated with the elements of the group and obeying the group multiplication rules.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The number of rows or columns of a representation matrix is called the <b>dimension</b> of the representation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Representations are said to be <b>equivalent</b> if they are connected by a <b>similarity transformation</b>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Equivalent matrices have the same trace.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A representation is said to be <b>reducible</b> if it is equivalent to a representation with diagonal block form.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A representation is said to be <b>irreducible</b> if it is not possible to reduce all matrices representing the elements of the group into block forms by a similarity transformation.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Lemma (Constant Matrix)</h3>
    <h4>Statement</h4>
    <p>
      Any representation by matrices with non-vanishing determinants is equivalent through a similarity transformation to a representation by unitary matrices.
    </p>
    <h4>Proof</h4>
    <p>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Schur's Lemma</h3>
    <h4>Statement</h4>
    <p>
      Any matrix that commutes with all the matrices of an irreducable representation must be a <b>constant matrix</b> (a multiple of the unit matrix).
    </p>
    <p>
      The contrapositive is that if a non-constant commuting matrix exists then the representation is reducible.
    </p>
    <h4>Proof</h4>

    <h3>Great Orthogonality Theorem</h3>
    <h4>Statement</h4>
    <p>
      All non-equivalent, irreducable, and unitary representations of a group satisfy the following relation:
