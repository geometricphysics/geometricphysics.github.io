  <section>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Warning: This treatment of differntial forms is a work in progress!
    </p>
    <p>
      This initial approach was based on coordinates. The goals are (1) to make contact with geometric algebra, (2) to use geometric objects (coordinate-free) as much as possible and to provide coordinate representations (3) to provide pictorial interpretations. Note that geometric algebra texts consider the algebra to be the <em>maths</em> and the geometry to be the interpretation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Differential geometry appears to be "isomorphic" to Geometric algebra. The correspondence is between the dual basis vectors (reciprocal vectors) $\Vector{e}^i$ and the elementary differential $1$-forms $dx^i$. The differential $1$-forms are considered to be linear functionals on the vector space $V$ and occupying the dual space $V^*$. So differential forms occupy a space that is distinct from the vectors. This makes them a bit different from the reciprocal vectors which share the same vector space. From a correspondence standpoint, we can make the association
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      dx^i &amp; \leftrightarrow &amp; \Vector{e}^i
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      This suggests that we should also extend the action of the elementary differentials on vectors to the dual basis vectors
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      dx^i(\Vector{v}) &amp; = &amp; \Vector{e}^i(\Vector{v}) = v^i
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Geometric Algebra tries to achieve the same result by using the defining property of the dual basis vectors (reciprocal frame) $\{\Vector{e}^k \}$
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \Vector{e}^i \cdot \Vector{e}_j &amp; = &amp; \delta^i_j
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, through the inner product which is the symmetrized geometric product.
    </p>
    <p>
      The treatment here builds manifolds into the definition of integration rather than taking the apparently ad-hoc approach that is usual for integration of (1) ordering the $r$-forms correctly, (2) dropping the wedge symbols, (3) perform the multivariable integration.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Geometric Algebra or Differential Geometry approaches may require more preparation than the Gibbs vector analysis, there seems to be generous payback in (1) mathematical unity, (2) visualization, (3) longevity, flexibility and utility. It would appear that clinging to either an orthogonal basis or a metric with a euclidean signature allows us to postpone the introduction of the dual space. But it is precisely the dual space that provides the mathematical unity, better visualization and the ability to handle curvature.

    <h3>Vectors</h3>
    <p>
      Vectors can be defined in a number of ways. The introductory appraoch is an oriented directed line segment joining two points. The more sophisticated approach is as the tangent vector to a curve (a parameterized set of points).
    </p>
  </section>
    <h3>The Metric Tensor</h3>
    <p>
      The metric tensor is a machine for computing a real number from two vectors. It is linear and symmetric in the vectors inserted. Because it is linear, if we know what it computes for a given basis, then we can compute the output for any input.
    </p>

      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \Tensor{g}(\Vector{u},\Vector{v})
      &amp; = &amp;
      g(u^{\mu}\Vector{e}_{\mu},v^{\nu}\Vector{e}_{\nu}) \\
      &amp; = &amp;
      u^{\mu} v^{\nu} \Tensor{g}(\Vector{e}_{\mu},\Vector{e}_{\nu}) \\
      &amp; = &amp;
      g_{\mu \nu} u^{\mu} v^{\nu}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $

    <h3>Manifolds</h3>
    <p>
      Let $\Vector{X}: \RealField^{k} \rightarrow \RealField^{n}$. i.e, $\Vector{X}$ is a function that maps a point $\Vector{u} = (u^1, u^2, \ldots, u^k)$ in a $k$-dimensional space to a point in an $n$-dimensional space.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <em>$k$-manifold</em>, $M$, is the image, $\Vector{X}(D)$, in $\RealField^{n}$ of a bounded open region $D$ in $\RealField^{k}$.
    </p>
    <p>
      We say that the manifold $M$ is parameterized by the function $\Vector{X}$.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we say "$M$ is a smooth manifold" we mean
      <ul>
        <li>The function $\Vector{X}$ is $C^1$.</li>
        <li>The function $\Vector{X}$ is injective (it maps distinct points to distinct points).</li>
        <li>The tangent vectors $\partial \Vector{X}/ \partial u^1, \partial \Vector{X}/ \partial u^2, \ldots, \partial \Vector{X}/ \partial u^k$ are independent.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      $

    <h3>Differential Forms (Geometric Approach)</h3>
    <p>
      We start by introducing a $1$-form as a machine that acts on a vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \omega(\Vector{v}) &amp; = &amp; \langle \omega, \Vector{v} \rangle
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      We imagine a $1$-form $\omega$ pictorially as a sequence of (hyper)planes of constant value. When $\omega$ acts on a vector it pierces the hyperplanes. The result is the change in value from the tail of the vector to the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every $1$-form has a corresponding unique vector and every vector has a corresponding unique $1$-form.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      (\Inverse{\Phi}(\omega)) \cdot \Vector{v} &amp; = &amp; \langle \omega, \Vector{v} \rangle
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \Vector{u} \cdot \Vector{v} &amp; = &amp; \langle \Phi(\Vector{u}), \Vector{v} \rangle
      \end{eqnarray}
      $

    <h3>Differential Forms (Coordinate Approach)</h3>
    <p>
      A <em>general</em> differential $0$-form $\omega$ on $\RealField^n$ is an expression like
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \omega &amp; = &amp; f(x^1, x^2, \ldots, x^n)
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that like $f$, the coordinate $x^i$ is a function on $\RealField^{n}$.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <em>general</em> differential $1$-form $\omega$ is an expression like
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \omega &amp; = &amp; \sum_{i=1}^{n} F_{i}(\Vector{x}) dx^{i}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      In geometric algebra terms, a <em>general</em> differential $1$-form is a linear combination of dual basis vectors, and is therefore vector-valued.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \omega &amp; = &amp; \sum_{i=1}^{n} F_{i}(\Vector{x}) \Vector{e}^{i}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>basic</em> or <em>elementary</em> differential $1$-form $\omega$ is an expression like
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      dx^{i}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      where $1 \le i \le n$.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>basic</em> or <em>elementary</em> 1-form $dx^{i}$ is a function that acts on a single vector $\Vector{v}$ and outputs $v^{i}$, the $i$th component of $\Vector{v}$. 
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      dx^{i}(\Vector{v})
      &amp; = &amp;
      v^{i}.
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      This makes it apparent that a <em>general</em> 1-form is a function that takes a vector and returns the type of $F_{i}$.
      We also remark that a 0-form is a function with no arguments.
      However, both forms depend on the coordinates of the point $\Vector{x}$.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>basic</em> or <em>elementary</em> differential $2$-form $\omega$ is an expression like
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      dx^{i} \wedge dx^{j},
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      where $1 \le i,j \le n$.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>basic</em> or <em>elementary</em> 2-form is a function with two vector arguments
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      dx^{i} \wedge dx^{j}(\Vector{u},\Vector{v})
      &amp; = &amp;
      \det
      \left[
        \begin{array}{cccccccc}
            dx^{i}(\Vector{u}) &amp; dx^{i}(\Vector{v}) \\
            dx^{j}(\Vector{u}) &amp; dx^{j}(\Vector{v})
        \end{array}
      \right]
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice how the implementation of the elementary 2-form uses the implementation of the elementary 1-form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notation of differential forms reflects the Grassman exterior product, while the action of the elementary forms reflects the scalar product.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <em>general</em> differential 2-form $\omega$ is an expression of the form
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \omega &amp; = &amp; \sum_{1 \le i \lt j \le n}F_{ij}(\Vector{x}) dx^{i} \wedge dx^{j},
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice how we have restricted the sum because the elementary 2-forms are not independent. There are only $(n^2 - n)/2$ that are independent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The action of the 2-form as a function is obtained by combining the expression with the action of the basic 2-forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The action of the elementary forms is purely one of extracting the coordinates in a prescribed manner. There is no concept of a metric in the elementary forms. It would appear that differential forms have a tensoral nature and yet they embody the antisymmetry properties of the exterior product. So they appear to avoid some of the redundancy of the tensor formalism but at the same time appear to have a component flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a geometric algebra perspective, the forms share the exterior algebra, and yet the action of the general $k$-forms on $k$ vectors is always to return a 0-form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The generalization to <em>elementary</em> and <em>general</em> $k$-forms is as we would expect. A <em>general</em> $k$-form is a linear superposition of <em>elementary</em> $k$-forms in which the coefficients are functions of position.
    </p>

    <h3>Integration</h3>
    <p>
      When we integrate a $k$-form, we do so over a $k$-manifold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's integrate a $1$-form over a $1$-manifold. Suppose $M = \Vector{X}(t)$ over the domain $a \le t \le b$, is a smooth $1$-manifold in $\RealField^{n}$. $1$-forms are naturally integrated along a curve. This requires a vector. The vector defined for a <b>parametric curve</b> $\Vector{X}(t) : [a,b] \rightarrow V$ is the tangent vector $\frac{d \Vector{X}}{d t}$. The domain is not just a set of points. It is a trajectory of a particle travelling along the curve. We wavt to assume that the particle travels without stopping, so the tangent vector is never zero. The tangent vector then gives a direction to the curve called the <b>orientation</b>. The pairing of the $1$-form $\omega \in \Lambda^1(V^*)$ with the tangent vector $\frac{d \Vector{X}}{d t} \in \Lambda^1(V)$ produces a scalar.
    </p>
    <p>
      We define the integral of the $1$-form $\omega$ over the manifold $M$ as
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \int_{M} \omega &amp; = &amp; \int_{a}^{b} \omega(\frac{d \Vector{X}}{d t}) dt
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      You can see that we are making use of the fact that a <em>general</em> $k$-form is a function. The interesting point to note is that we use the tangent vector as the argument to $\omega$ as the integrand. The left hand side is the integration of the $1$-form $\omega$ over a curve in $M$. The right hand side is an integral of a scalar function over the real line. This is an example of <b>pullback</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The integral is straight-forward to evaluate by applying the action of the <em>elementary</em> $1$-form. The only thing to remember is that the coordinates $x^i$ that appear in the differential form are replaced by the parameters from the function $\Vector{X}(t) = \langle x^1(t), x^2(t), \ldots, x^n(t) \rangle$ that parameterizes the manifold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The integral of a $1$-form over a $1$-manifold has a connection to a line integral of a vector field for an appropriate $1$-form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose that $\Vector{F}(\Vector{x}) = \langle F_1(\Vector{x}), F_2(\Vector{x}), \ldots, F_n(\Vector{x}) \rangle$ is a vector field in $\RealField^{n}$. Define the differential $1$-form
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \omega &amp; = &amp; \sum_{i = 1}^{n} F_{i} dx^{i} = F_1 dx^1 + F_2 dx^2 + \cdots + F_n dx^n.
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      We should regard a Newtonian force $F$ as a $1$-form. The integral of $F$ over a curve is the work done. This means that the force $1$-form plays the role of a density being energy per unit length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \int_{M} \omega
      &amp; = &amp;
      \int_{a}^{b} \omega(\frac{d \Vector{X}}{d t}) dt \\
      &amp; = &amp;
      \int_{a}^{b} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} F_{i} dx^{i}(\frac{d \Vector{X}}{d t}) dt \\
      &amp; = &amp;
      \int_{a}^{b} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} F_{i} \frac{d X^{i}}{d t} dt \\
      &amp; = &amp;
      \int_{a}^{b} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} F_{i} d X^{i} \\
      &amp; = &amp;
      \int_{M} \Vector{F} \cdot \Vector{dX}.
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      We now generalize to define the integral of the $2$-form $\omega$ over the a $2$-manifold $M$ as
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \int_{M} \omega
      &amp; = &amp;
      \int_{D} \omega(\frac{\partial \Vector{X}}{\partial u^1},\frac{\partial \Vector{X}}{\partial u^2}) du^1 du^2
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      The integral of a $2$-form over a $2$-manifold has a connection to a surface integral of the flux of a vector field for an appropriate $2$-form (so long as the manifold is in $\RealField^3$).
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose that $\Vector{F}(\Vector{x}) = \langle F_1(\Vector{x}), F_2(\Vector{x}), \ldots, F_n(\Vector{x}) \rangle$ is a vector field in $\RealField^{n}$. Define the differential $2$-form
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \omega &amp; = &amp; F_1 dx^2 \wedge dx^3 + F_2 dx^3 \wedge dx^1 + F_3 dx^1 \wedge dx^2.
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, using the crucial substitution (involving the cross product in 3 dimensions)
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      d \Vector{A}
      &amp; = &amp;
      \frac{\partial \Vector{X}}{\partial u^1} \times \frac{\partial \Vector{X}}{\partial u^2} du^1 du^2,
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      it is straigtforward to show
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \int_{M} \omega
      &amp; = &amp;
      \int_{M} \Vector{F} \cdot \Vector{dA}.
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      The integral of the $2$-form over a surface can be interpreted as a flux.
    </p>

    <h3>The Wedge Product</h3>
    <p>
      The linearity of differential forms allows us to add differential forms of the same grade. The exterior product allows us to perform a kind of multiplication.
    </p>
    <p>
      The algebra for coordinate differentials is anti-commutative.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      dx \wedge dy &amp; = &amp; - dy \wedge dx
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      By linearity it is also a fact that the exterior product of two $1$-forms is zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the outer product for $r$-forms with $r \ge 2$ is not generally zero, although it happens to be true for $n \le 3$.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we consider $\omega \in \Lambda^{j}(K)$ and $\eta \in \Lambda^{k}(K)$ then it is easy to show that
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \omega \wedge \eta &amp; = &amp; (-1)^{jk} \eta \wedge \omega
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      We generally don't use mixed forms. Forms of the same <em>degree</em> are called <b>homogeneous</b>.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>The Dual Space $\Dual{V}$ of $V$</h3>
    <p>
      The space $\Dual{V}$ of linear functionals on the vector space $V$ is introduced by considering the idea of an object that can act on vectors in $V$ with the property of <em>linearity</em>, addition and scalar multiplication. This means that $\Dual{V}$ is a vector space. When we attempt to introduce a basis using the rule $\Vector{e}^i(\Vector{v}) = v^i$ we must conclude $\Vector{e}^i(\Vector{e}_j) = \delta^i_j$. We can also prove that $\dim{(\Dual{V})} = \dim{(V)} = n$. It is clear that the <em>dual space of differential geometry is the equivalent of reciprocal space of geometric algebra</em>. However, because differential geometry sees the dual space as different from the vector space, treatments don't generally try to find an expression for the dual space basis in terms of the vector space basis.

    <h3>The Exterior Derivative</h3>
    <p>
      We have already integrated differential forms over a manifold. We now take a look at differentiation, and later we connect the two with a general theorem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exterior derivative of a $0$-form $f(\Vector{x})$ is
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      df &amp; = &amp; \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} dx^i
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly, we have created a $1$-form. That's the general rule. The <em>exterior derivative</em> $d$ is an operator that turns $k$-forms into $(k+1)$-forms. Notice that $df$ and $dx^{i}$ are the same kinds of objects since both $f$ and the coordinates $x^i$ are both functions on $\RealField^{n}$.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exterior drivative of the $k$-form

    <h3>grad, curl and div</h3>
    <p>
      We can demonstrate how the three vector operators occur naturally in differential forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      We simply compute the exterior derivative of the coefficients and wedge them with the corresponding elementary forms. Just apply $d$ to a $0$-form, $1$-form, and $2$-form. Recall that $d$ applied to a $3$-form is zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>grad</b> shows up in the operator $d$ acting on a $0$-form.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>curl</b> shows up in the operator $d$ acting on a $1$-form.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>div</b> shows up in the operator $d$ acting on a $2$-form.
    </p>
    <p>
      In three dimensions, the operator $d$ acting on a $3$-form is zero.

    <h3>The Poincar&#233; Lemma ($dd = 0$) and its Converse</h3>
    <p>
      If $\omega$ is a differential form then $dd \omega = 0$. This follows from the equality of mixed partial derivatives. In terms of standard vector analysis notation
    </p>
    <p>
      $d(df) = 0 \leftrightarrow \curl{(\gradient{f})}$
    </p>
    <p>
      $d(d \omega) = 0 \leftrightarrow \divergence{(\curl{\Vector{v}})}$
    </p>
    <p>
      The converse of the Poincar&#233; Lemma says that if $\omega \in \Lambda^r(K)$ is a differential form and $K$ is <em>simply connected</em> and $d \omega = 0$ then there exists $\alpha \in \Lambda^{r-1}(K)$ for which $d \alpha = \omega$.
    </p>

    <h3>Exactness</h3>
    <p>
      A differential $\omega$ is said to be <em>exact</em> if one can find a $C^2$ function $f(\Vector{x})$ with $df = \omega$.
    </p>

    <h3>Generalized Stoke's Theorem (The Boundary Theorem?)</h3>
    <p>
      Let $M$ be a smooth oriented $k$-manifold with consistently oriented smooth boundary $\partial M$. Let $\omega$ be a $k-1$ form defined in a neighborhood of $M$. Then
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \int_{M} d \omega &amp; = &amp; \int_{\partial M} \omega.
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the symmetry in the above expression, it can be memorized by recalling that (1) the $d$ operator acting on a $k$-form prduces a $(k+1)$-form, and (2) we generally integrate a $k$-form over a $k$-manifold, and finally (3) that the boundary of a $k$-manifold is a $(k-1)$-manifold.
      <ul>
        <li>$M$ is a $k$-manifold,</li>
        <li>$\partial M$ is a $(k-1)$-manifold,</li>
        <li>$\omega$ is a $(k-1)$-form,</li>
        <li>$d \omega$ is a $k$-form.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, this is stated without proof. With appropriate choices of differential forms we can show that it reproduces Stokes' theorem and Gauss's theorem.

    <h3>Maxwell's equations in Spacetime</h3>

      We treat the electric $\Vector{E} = E_1 \Vector{i} + E_2 \Vector{j} + E_3 \Vector{k}$ and magnetic $\Vector{B} = B_1 \Vector{i} + B_2 \Vector{j} + B_3 \Vector{k}$ fields as parts of a single field on space-time. The electromagmetic field is represented by a $2$-form
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      F &amp; = &amp;
      B_3 dx \wedge dy + B_1 dy \wedge dz + B_2 dz \wedge dx +
      E_1 dx \wedge dt + E_2 dy \wedge dt + E_3 dz \wedge dt
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      The dual of F is given by
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      *F &amp; = &amp;
      E_3 dx \wedge dy + E_1 dy \wedge dz + E_2 dz \wedge dx -
      B_1 dx \wedge dt - B_2 dy \wedge dt + B_3 dz \wedge dt
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice how the electric and magnetic fields changed signs in different ways under duality.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we now examine $dF = 0$, and assume that the four (4) trivectors are non-zero we get
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \divergence{\Vector{B}} &amp; = &amp; 0
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \curl{\Vector{E}} &amp;= &amp; - \frac{\partial \Vector{B}}{\partial t}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      It's interesting that both of these equations don't involve sources. Since $dF = 0$, there exists a $1$-form  from which $F$ is derived by the exterior derivative
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      F &amp;= &amp; d(A_1 dx + A_2 dy + A_3 dz + A_4 dt)
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Expanding the right hand side and comparing to the initial expression for $F$ reproduces the expected equations for $\Vector{B}$ and $\Vector{E}$ in terms of $\Vector{A}$ and $\varphi$.
    </p>
    <p>
      This provides an interesting starting point using $dd = 0$, which is a purely geometric statement. The $1$-form, derived from the magnetic vector potential and the spacetime dual basis vectors generates two of Maxwell's source free equations.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we compute $d*F$ then we are going to get linear combinations of trivectors again. So, in order to reproduce Maxwell's other two equations, Gauss's Law and Amp&#232;re's Law, we are going to need a four-current that is a linear combination of trivectors (module constants)
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      J &amp;= &amp;
       \rho dx \wedge dy \wedge dz
      - J_3 dx \wedge dy \wedge dt
      - J_1 dy \wedge dz \wedge dt
      - J_2 dz \wedge dx \wedge dt
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Since $dd = 0$ we must have $dd*F = dJ = 0$. This reproduces the continuity equation assuming that the pseudoscalar is non-zero.
