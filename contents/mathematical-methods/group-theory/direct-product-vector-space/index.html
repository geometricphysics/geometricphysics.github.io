        A <b>direct product vector space</b> is the cartesian product of vector spaces.

        Let $\{\Vector{u_1}, \Vector{u_2}, \ldots, \Vector{u_m} \}$ be basis vectors for a vector space $U$, and $\{\Vector{v_1}, \Vector{v_2}, \ldots, \Vector{v_n} \}$ be basis vectors for $V$. Then the $m n$ basis vectors for the direct product vector space $U \otimes V$ are $\{\Vector{u_i} \otimes \Vector{v_j}\}$.
      </p>
      <p>
        An arbitrary vector $\Vector{x}$ in the direct product space $U \otimes V$ has components $x^{ij}$ with respect to the basis vectors $\{\Vector{u_i} \otimes \Vector{v_j}\}$:

      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \Vector{x} &amp; = &amp; \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} x^{ij} \Vector{u_i} \otimes \Vector{u_j}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $

      Notice that, in general, an arbitrary vector in $U \otimes V$ cannot be constructed as the direct product of a vector in $V$ and a vector in $W$.
