        Let $\{\Vector{e_1}, \Vector{e_2}, \ldots, \Vector{e_m} \}$ be basis vectors for a vector space $U$, and $\{\Vector{f_1}, \Vector{f_2}, \ldots, \Vector{f_n} \}$ be basis vectors for $V$. Then the $m + n$ basis vectors for the direct sum vector space $U \oplus V$ are $\{\Vector{e_1}, \Vector{e_2}, \ldots, \Vector{e_m} ; \Vector{f_1}, \Vector{f_2}, \ldots, \Vector{f_n} \}$.
      </p>
      <p>
        If $\Vector{u} \in U$ and $\Vector{v} \in V$ have components $\{u^i \}$ and $\{v^i \}$, then both $\Vector{u}$ and $\Vector{v}$ may be considered as vectors in the direct sum space $U \oplus V$ with components given by 'padding the undefined coordinates' with zeros.

    <h3>Reducible Representations</h3>
    <p>
      If there exists a similarity transformation that will transform our original representation matrices into diagonal or block-diagonal form, meaning that the smaller portions or submatrices are no longer coupled together, then the original representation is said to be <b>reducible</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our original representation, $X$, is said to have been decomposed into a direct sum of component representations, $U, V, \ldots ,$.

      \begin{eqnarray}
      X &amp; = &amp; U \oplus V \oplus \cdots
      \end{eqnarray}
