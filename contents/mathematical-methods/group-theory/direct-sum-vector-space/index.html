    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <p>
      A <b>direct sum</b> vector space is a vector space constructed from two vector spaces.

    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <span class="definition">
      <p>
        Let $\{e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_m \}$ be basis vectors for a vector space $U$ and $\{f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_n \}$ be basis vectors for $V$. Then the $m + n$ basis vectors for the direct sum vector space $U \oplus V$ are $\{e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_m ; f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_n \}$.
      </p>
      <p>
        If $\Vector{u} \in U$ and $\Vector{v} \in V$ have components $\{u^i \}$ and $\{v^i \}$, then both $\Vector{u}$ and $\Vector{v}$ may be considered as vectors in the direct sum space $U \oplus V$ with components given by 'padding the undefined coordinates' with zeros.

    <h3>Reducible Representations</h3>
    <p>
      If there exists a similarity transformation that will transform our original representation matrices into diagonal or block-diagonal form, meaning that the smaller portions or submatrices are no longer coupled together, then the original representation is said to be <b>reducible</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our original representation, $X$, is said to have been decomposed into a direct sum of component representations, $U, V, \ldots ,$.

      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      X &amp; = &amp; U \oplus V \oplus \cdots
      \end{eqnarray}
