  <h1>Thermodynamics</h1>
  <section>
    <h3>Thermal Equilibrium</h3>
    <p>A condition in which two bodies in thermal contact have no net exchange of energy in the form of heat.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics</h3>
    <p>If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then the two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with each other.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>The First Law of Thermodynamics</h3>
    <p>This law is a statement of conservation of energy</p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \Delta U &amp; = &amp; Q + W \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
      where
      <ul>
        <li>$U$ is the <em>internal energy</em> of the system</li>
        <li>$W = - P \Delta V$ for an ideal gas</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>The Second Law of Thermodynamics</h3>
    <p>For any cyclic heat engine, some exhaust heat is always produced.</p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        e &amp; = &amp; \frac{Q_{H} - Q_{C}}{Q_{H}} \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
      where
      <ul>
        <li>$e$ is the <em>thermal efficiency</em> of the heat engine</li>
        <li>$Q_{H}$ is the heat supplied to the engine in one cycle</li>
        <li>$Q_{C}$ is the heat exhaust by the engine in one cycle</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>The Carnot Cycle</h3>
    <p>A heat engine utilizing the Carnot cycle has the highest possible efficiency consistent with the Second Law of Thermodynamics.</p>
    <p>A Carnot cycle uses isothermal ($\Delta T = 0$) and adiabatic ($Q = 0$) compressions and expansions of a gas.</p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        e_{C} &amp; = &amp; \frac{T_{H} - T_{C}}{T_{H}} \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
      where
      <ul>
        <li>$e_{C}$ is the <em>thermal efficiency</em> of the Carnot engine</li>
        <li>$T_{H}$ is the temperature of the input gas</li>
        <li>$T_{C}$ is the temperature of the exhaust gas</li>
      </ul>
