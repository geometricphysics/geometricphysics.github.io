    <h3>Path Approximation</h3>
    <p>
      A continuous path can be approximated by a finite number $N$ of straight line segments.
    </p>
    <h3>Path Calculus</h3>
    <p>
      In the limit as the $N \rightarrow \infty$ the path approximation becomes equivalent to the continuous path.
    </p>
    <h3>Alternative Path Postulate</h3>
    <p>
      Alternative paths are paths that have the same initial spacetime coordinates and the same final spacetime coordinates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resultant amplitude for alternative paths is the sum of the amplitudes for each alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      K = \sum_{i} K_i
      $
    </p>
    <h3>Sequential Path Postulate</h3>
    <p>
      Two paths are sequential if the final coordinates of the first are equal to the initial coordinates of the 
    </p>
    <p>
      The resultant amplitude for sequential paths is multiplicative.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      K_{CA} = K_{CB} K_{BA}
      $
    </p>
    <h3>Propagator Postulate</h3>
    <p>
      We use one coordinate $q$ to represent the position transverse to the initial-final axis and use time $t$ as a proxy for the longitudinal progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amplitude $K$ for an infinitesimal path from $(q, t)$ to $(q + \Delta q, t + \Delta t)$ is assumed to be
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray*}
      K &amp; = &amp; \langle q + \Delta q, t + \Delta t | e^{-i H \Delta t} |q, t \rangle
      \end{eqnarray*}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Empirically, $H$ is determined to be the quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian operator.
