    <h3>Orbital Angular Momentum of Electrons is Quantized</h3>
    <p>
      Accelerating charges should emit radiation and thus electrons in atomic orbits should continuously emit radiation so that they spiral into the nucleus. Bohr postulated that an electron could orbit the nucleus without spiralling towards the center if the angular momentum of the orbit was quantized. Only transitions between these orbits would be allowed. There was no explaination of why the orbital angular momentum should be quantized, but the crucial step was to recognize that a <b>quantum rule</b> would be required to account for the experimental data. Later, de Broglie would re-interpret the quantized angular momentum as a standing wave.

    <h3>Experimental Observation: Atomic Spectra</h3>
    <p>
      The visible wavelengths that appear in the emission spectrum of Hydrogen are summarized in the <b>Rydberg formula</b> for the <b>Balmer series</b> of lines<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \frac{1}{\lambda} &amp; = &amp; R (\frac{1}{n^{2}_{f}} - \frac{1}{n^{2}_{i}})\\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      where $R$ is the Rydberg constant ~ $1.1 \times 10^{-7} m^{-1}$.

    <h3>Bohr Model</h3>
    <p>
      The kinetic energy of an orbiting electron is
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        T &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2} m v^{2}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      We assume that the centripetal acceleration is provided by the electrostatic interaction between the electron and the nucleus and we consider only circlular orbits.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \frac{m v^{2}}{r} &amp; = &amp; \frac{Z e^{2}}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} r^{2}}
      \label{Centripetal}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      The centripetal force equation (circular motion) $\ref{Centripetal}$ constrains the speed to be a function of the radius of the orbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the kinetic energy is
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        T(r) &amp; = &amp; \frac{Z e^{2}}{8 \pi \epsilon_{0} r}
        \label{KineticEnergy}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      The potential energy of a the orbiting electron is (being careful with the signs)
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        V(r) &amp; = &amp; \frac{(+Z e)(-e)}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} r} = - \frac{Ze^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} r}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      and thus the total energy of the system is
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      E(r) &amp; = &amp; T + V &amp; = &amp; - \frac{Z e^{2}}{8 \pi \epsilon_{0} r} \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Bohr now imposed the condition on the angular momentum
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        L &amp; = &amp; m v r &amp; = &amp; n \hbar
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      This is equivalent to saying that the de Broglie wavelength exactly fits into the circular orbit, which is slightly more intuitive from a wave perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      The angular momentum condition provides another expression for $v(r)$ and so can be combined with the centripetal force equation $\ref{Centripetal}$ to provide an expression for $r$ in terms of the quantum number $n$ (i.e. eliminate $v$)
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \frac{1}{r} &amp; = &amp; \frac{Z e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{m}{(n \hbar)^2}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      This is quite useful because it shows that $r_{n} \propto n^2$.
    </p>
    <p>
      This established the energy of an orbit as
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        E_{n} &amp; = &amp; - 2 m (\frac{Z e^{2}}{8 \pi \epsilon_{0} \hbar})^{2} \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      We see that $E_{n} \propto (\frac{1}{n})^2$.
