  <h1>The Photoelectric Effect</h1>
  <section>
    <h3>It's not just about electrons being emitted from a metal by light</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately, the following home-made demonstration forgets that there is a bigger idea.</p>

    <h3>Good discussion of the practicalities of demonstrating the effect in a simple laboratory</h3>
    <p>But still no discusssion of quanta, frequencies, work functions, ...</p>

    <h3>The Energy of the emitted electrons depends on the frequency of the light</h3>
    <p>This demonstration makes this simple point. Unfortunately, the apparatus is not described and there is no theory.</p>

    <h3>Ill-defined conclusion that light behaves as a particle</h3>
    <p>Finally, we have a qualitative and quantitative explaination.</p>
    <p>Unfortunate phrase "This experiment can only be explained if we assume light behaves as a particle (photon)", but there is no discussion of what it means to be a particle and how the connection is made.</p>

    <h3>Demonstration and discussion using software and physical experiment</h3>
    <p>Nicely demonstrates the difference between the classical expectations and the quantum explaination.</p>

    <h3>Dependence of the current on max kinetic energy and voltage</h3>
    <p>Simple but clear analysis of energy conservation to determine cutoff and pinch voltage.</p>
