  <h1>The Photoelectric Effect</h1>
  <section>
    <h3>The Big Idea: Quanta</h3>
    <p>
      When light interacts with matter, energy is exchanged in discrete amounts called <b>quanta</b>. For a given frequency of light, $\nu$, the energy of the quantum is<br/><br/>
      $
      E = h \nu
      $,<br/><br/>
      where $h$ is <b>Planck's constant</b>, determined experimentally.
    </p>

    <h3>Experiment and Observation</h3>
    <p>
      When light illuminates a metal, <b>photoelectrons</b> may be emitted and the maximim kinetic energy of the electrons varies as<br/><br/>
      $
      K_{max} = h \nu - \phi
      $,<br/><br/>
      where $\phi$ is the <b>work function</b> of the metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following phenomena are observed<br/><br/>
      <ul>
        <li>The maximum kinetic energy depends on the frequency of the light source.</li>
        <li>The is a lowest cutoff frequency below which no electrons are emitted.</li>
        <li>The intensity of the light source only affects the number of electrons emitted.</li>
        <li>The electrons are emitted almost instantaneously following illumination.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Classical Wave Theory Fails to Explain Phenomenon</h3>
    <p>
      This phenomenon cannot be explained by the classical, wave theory of light which would predict
      <ul>
        <li>Increasing the intensity of the light would increase the kinetic energy of the electrons.</li>
        <li>Electrons would be emitted regardless of the frequency of the light.</li>
        <li>There could be a significant time delay between illumination and ejection of electrons as electrons accumulate enough energy to escape the atom(s) to which they were bound.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Quantum Theory</h3>
    <p>
      The phenomenon is explained with the following assumptions
      <ul>
        <li>When light interacts with electrons the energy exchanged is quantized.</li>
        <li>The quanta of light energy are called photons.</li>
        <li>The energy of a photon is $E = h \nu$.</li>
        <li>An photoelectron interacts with one quantum of light.</li>
        <li>Energy is conserved</li>
        <li>Some of the energy of the quantum goes into allowing the electron to escape the metal. This quantity of energy is characteristic of the metal and is called the work function, $\phi$.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Wave-Particle Duality?</h3>
    <p>
      It is often concluded that electromagnetic radiation behaves both like a particle and like a wave. If we consider that a particle is actually a point-like object with no size or internal structure then this conclusion starts to appear extreme and unfounded. While it is true that energy is exchanged in discrete amounts, this does not provide evidence that the photons are strongly localized in space as particles. The modern view is that photons are excitations of the electromagnetic field and have spatial extent.

    <h3>Experimental Details</h3>
    <p>
      The following videos illustrate the effect qualitatively. A more quantitative experiment involves evacutating the region around the metal and using a voltage to investigate the kinetic energy.

    <h3>It's not just about electrons being emitted from a metal by light</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately, the following home-made demonstration forgets that there is a bigger idea.</p>

    <h3>Good discussion of the practicalities of demonstrating the effect in a simple laboratory</h3>
    <p>But still no discusssion of quanta, frequencies, work functions, ...</p>

    <h3>The Energy of the emitted electrons depends on the frequency of the light</h3>
    <p>This demonstration makes this simple point. Unfortunately, the apparatus is not described and there is no theory.</p>

    <h3>Ill-defined conclusion that light behaves as a particle</h3>
    <p>Finally, we have a qualitative and quantitative explaination.</p>
    <p>Unfortunate phrase "This experiment can only be explained if we assume light behaves as a particle (photon)", but there is no discussion of what it means to be a particle and how the connection is made.</p>

    <h3>Demonstration and discussion using software and physical experiment</h3>
    <p>Nicely demonstrates the difference between the classical expectations and the quantum explaination.</p>
