  <h1>Curriculum</h1>
  <section>
    <h3>Goals, Overview and Approach</h3>
    <p>
      This is an exciting course that attempts to move away from the historical pedagogy to a synthesis of modern ideas based on fundamental particles and their interactions with modern geometric mathematics that exposes the physical concepts and supports efficient computation. The ideas of invariants, symmetries and transformations are introduced as early as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Experiments are used to emphasize good scientific technique and not to discover every single phenomena (which can waste time and is not sustainable in the long run). Instead, videos are used to observe experiments conducted by others in more natural environments or with better precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Authentic problems are presented, requiring critical thinking, technical skills and programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      A student completing this course will have a broad qualitative overview of the big ideas in modern physics with deep practice in the fundamental areas that are the foundation for specialization in areas such as condensed matter, atomic, nuclear, earth science, optics and engineering.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h3>Introduction to Physics</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of this introduction is to motivate and inspire the student. Qualitative connections are made from the frontiers of modern physics to everyday phenomena.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fundamental quantum particles (quarks, leptons and bosons) are related to the periodic table, the 4 fundamental interactions are introduced and connected to macroscopic phenomena and concepts of scale. The concepts of particles and fields are discussed.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h3>Science, Physics and Mathematics, Technology and Ethics</h3>
    <p>
      The scientific method is presented as well as the process of publication and peer review. The concepts of theory and physical law are clarified as well as the relationship to mathematics. The aspects of technical mastery, implementation, intended and unintended consequences are discussed in an ethical context.
    </p>

    <h3>Mathematical Baseline</h3>
    <p>
      The mathematical maturity required to begin this course will be typical of a strong mathematical student who has studied calculus.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Geometric Algebra</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose is to start laying the foundation of geometric objects that can be used to describe physics in a coordinate-free form that emphasizes invariants rather than transformations.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Classical Mechanics</h3>
    <p>
      Particle mechanics, Newtonian formulation, Lagrangian and Hamilton formulations.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Spacetime</h3>
    <p>
      Introduce the mystery of time and 4-dimensional hyperbolic space as the natural setting for electrodynamics and Dirac theory.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Electrodynamics</h3>
    <p>
      Electricity and Magnetism from both empirical (historical) and theoretical (spacetime) discovery.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Quantum Theory</h3>
    <p>
      Introduction to quantum particles and wave mechanics.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics</h3>
    <p>
      A modern view of thermodynamics based upon microstates and the partition function.
