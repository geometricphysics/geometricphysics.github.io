    <h3>Coordinate Frame</h3>
    <p>A coordinate frame in an $n$-dimensional vector space is a way of assigning $n$ numbers to a point. Mathematically, it is equivalent to a set of $n$ scalar functions of position, $\vec{x}$,<br/><br/>
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
      x^{i} &amp; = &amp; x^{i}(\vec{x}) \\
    \end{eqnarray}
    $,<br/><br/>
    where
    </p>
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
      i &amp; = &amp; 1, \ldots , n \\
    \end{eqnarray}
    $.
    <p>
      The coordinates of a point $\vec{x}$ will be denoted as $(x^{1} , \ldots , x^{n}) = (x^{1}(\vec{x}) , \ldots , x^{n}(\vec{x}))$.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason for using numbers is that points which are close together will have similar coordinates and we can suppliment the vector space with the concept of a metric which allows distances to be computed from coordinates.

    <h3>Notation</h3>
    <p>
      The superscript notation that we have used for coordinate indices anticipates other types of objects for which we will want to use a subscript notation and so is a deliberate ploy to use the index position to identify the type of the object. However, the trade off is that it may conflict with exponents. It should be clear from the context whether an exponent is index of a coordinate or an exponent. In those cases where we require both exponents and coordinate indices, we use parenthesis, e.g. $(x^{i})^{m}$ means the $i$th coordinate raised to the $m$th power.

    <h3>Rectangular Coordinate Frame</h3>
    <p>
      A rectangular coordinate frame is one in which the distance, $AB$, between two arbitrary points $A$ with coordinates $(a^{1},\ldots,a^{n})$ and $B$ with coordinates $(b^{1},\ldots,b^{n})$ is given by<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        AB &amp; = &amp; \sqrt(\sum_{i=1}^{n} (a^{i} - b^{i})^{2}) \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $.

    <h3>Curvilinear Coordinate Frame</h3>
    <p>
      Informally, a curvilinear coordinate frame is one in which the <em>curvilinear coordinates</em> are connected to those of a rectangular coordinate frame by a set of $n$ scalar functions of the coordinates.<br/><br/>
