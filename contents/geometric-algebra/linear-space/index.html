    <h3>Geometric Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      Giuseppe Peano, in 1888, formally defined a <b>vector space</b>, or <em>linear system</em>, as he called it. Today we use the terms <em>vector space</em> and <b>linear space</b> interchangeably. A vector space definition talks about objects called <b>vectors</b> and <b>scalars</b> and how they are related. You'll probably hear about these mathematical objects as having the properties (or not) of <b>magnitude</b> and <b>direction</b>. You might also hear about vectors being described as lists of numbers. It can be quite confusing knowing where to start. We will start with Giuseppe's formal definition and then see how we can interpret the mathematical objects as geometric quantities. Along the way we'll clarify how the various definitions and concepts are related making these vague notions more clear as we go.

    <h3>Inverse</h3>
    <p>
      Show that for any $u \in \mathit{Cl}_2$, $u \bar{u} = \bar{u} u \in \mathbb{R}$, and that $u$ is invertible, if $u \bar{u} \neq 0$, with inverse
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      u^{-1} = \frac{\bar{u}}{u \bar{u}}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let $u = u^0 + u^1 e_1 + u^2 e_2 + u^{12} e_{12}$. Then
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \bar{u} &amp; = &amp; \sum_k (-1)^{\frac{1}{2} k (k+1)} {\langle u \rangle}_k = u^0 - u^1 e_1 - u^2 e_2 - u^{12} e_{12}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      u \bar{u}
      &amp; = &amp; (u^0 + u^1 e_1 + u^2 e_2 + u^{12} e_{12})(u^0 - u^1 e_1 - u^2 e_2 - u^{12} e_{12}) \\
      &amp; = &amp; (u^0)^2 - (u^1)^2 - (u^2)^2 + (u^{12})^2
      \end{eqnarray}
      $.
