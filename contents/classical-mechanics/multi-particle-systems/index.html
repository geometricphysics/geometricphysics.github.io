    <h3>Equilibrium of Forces (Empirical)</h3>
    <p>
      From empirical observations, we find that an extended body does not show a linear acceleration provided that the sum of the <b>external forces</b> acting on the body is zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \sum_{i} \Vector{F}_i
        &amp; = &amp;
        \Vector{0}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="important">remarkable thing about this empirical law is that there is no reference to any internal forces between the particles</span>, which certainly do exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      This law is normally deduced using rigid bodies by observing the motion of any particle in the body. A detailed study shows that the center of mass does not accelerate if the net external forces are zero.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Equilibrium of Torques (Empirical)</h3>
    <p>
      We also find that the condition for no angular acceleration is that the sum of the torques (moment of force) taken about an arbitrary point is also zero
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \sum_{i} \Vector{r}_i \times \Vector{F}_i &amp; = &amp; \Vector{0}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      But these laws are not fundamental, or more precisely, there are more fundamental laws from which we can deduce these conditions. In order to derive these conditions, we start by considering systems consisting of more than one particle. We then add the constraint that the particles in the system have a fixed relationship to each other. But first, we study systems where the particles are free to move in relation to one another.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Total Mass</h3>
    <p>
      The first thing to remark is that our system now has a property that we shall call the <b>total mass</b>, $M$. It's simply the sum of the masses of all the constituent particles.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        M
        &amp; = &amp;
        \sum_{i} m_i
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      The index $i$ runs over all the particles in the system, and $m_i$ is the mass of the $i$-th particle. Notice that the total mass is a property of the system, and not of any one particle.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Center of Mass</h3>
    <p>
      Suppose that some particles have more mass than others or that there are more particles in some region of the system. We'd like to have some system property that reflects where 'most' of the mass of the system is located. We define this concept more precisely with the <b>center of mass</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>center of mass</b>, $\Vector{X}_{CM}$, of a system of particles is the mass-weighted sum of the positions of all the particles.<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \Vector{X}_{CM}
      &amp; = &amp;
      \frac{\sum_{i} m_{i} \Vector{r}_i}{\sum_{i} m_{i}}
      &amp; = &amp;
      \frac{\sum_{i} m_{i} \Vector{r}_i}{M}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Total Momentum</h3>
    <p>
      We can also sum up the individual momenta, the momentum of each particle to obtain a <b>total momentum</b>, $\Vector{P}$ for a sytem of particles.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \Vector{P}
        &amp; = &amp;
        \sum_{i} \Vector{p}_i
        &amp; = &amp;
        \sum_{i} m_i \Vector{v}_i
        &amp; = &amp;
        M \frac{d \Vector{X}_{CM}}{d t}
        &amp; = &amp;
        M \Vector{V}_{CM}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      We have assumed in this derivation that the particle mass is constant in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The connection between the total momentum $\Vector{P}$ and the total mass $M$ and center of mass velocity $\Vector{V}_{CM}$ is rather interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      It follows that<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \Vector{V}_{CM} = 0 \Leftrightarrow \Vector{P} = 0
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, in a frame of reference in which the total momentum is zero, the center of mass does not move. Or, in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Equilibrium of Forces (Theorem)</h3>
    <p>
      If we now consider the motion of the center of mass then we find that it depends only on the external forces on the system. The internal forces are of no consequence by Newton's 3d Law.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      M \Vector{X}_{CM}
      &amp; = &amp;
      \sum_i m_i \Vector{r}_i
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      M \dot{\Vector{X}}_{CM}
      &amp; = &amp;
      \sum_i m_i \dot{\Vector{r}}_i
      &amp; = &amp;
      \sum_i \Vector{p}_i
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      M \ddot{\Vector{X}}_{CM}
      &amp; = &amp;
      \sum_i \dot{\Vector{p}}_i
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      The rate of change of momentum of the $i$-th particle is equal to the total force on the same particle which has contributions from external and internal forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \dot{\Vector{p}}_i
      &amp; = &amp;
      \Vector{F}_i + \sum_{j \ne i} \Vector{f}_{ij}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      When we substitute this expression and sum, the internal forces cancel in pairs because of Newton's 3rd Law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interestingly, it's a bit more work to make the empirical law precise. We would probably have to treat the rigid body as a comvex shape and argue that the center of mass lies within the simplex defined by its points!
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      M \ddot{\Vector{X}}_{CM}
      &amp; = &amp;
      \sum_i \Vector{F}_i
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p class="theorem">
      The equation of motion of the center of mass only depends on the net external forces.

    <h3>Moment of a Vector about a Point</h3>
    <p>
      For any vector quantity, we can construct another property that describes the relation of the property to some origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose $\Vector{s}$ is a vector passing through the point with position vector $\Vector{r}$, then the vector <b>$\Vector{r} \times \Vector{s}$</b> is called the <b>moment of the vector $\Vector{s}$ about the origin</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now define several quantities that are moments of vectors.
    </p>
    <p class="important">
      The moment of a vector depends on the choice of origin. This is precisely what makes rotational physics a tricky subject. Some introductory approaches hide the issues by computing these quantities from special reference frames.
    </p>
    <p class="todo">
      It would be interesting to take various partial observables and characterize how they depend upon the frame of reference.

    <h3>Angular Momentum</h3>
    <p>
      The <b>angular momentum</b> of a particle is the <b>moment of the linear momentum</b> of the particle about the origin.<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \Vector{L} = \Vector{r} \times \Vector{p}.

    <h3>Torque (Angular Force)</h3>
    <p>
      The <b>torque</b> is the <b>moment of the force</b> about the origin.<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \Vector{N} = \Vector{r} \times \Vector{F}.

    <h3>Total Angular Momentum for a System of Particles</h3>
    <p>
      Suppose that we want to calculate the total angular momentum, $\Vector{L}$ of a system of particles.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \Vector{L} = \sum_i \Vector{r}_i \times \Vector{p}_i
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      What should we take as the origin for the $\Vector{r}_i$? Does it matter what we choose for the origin? Certainly, the linear momentum of each particle does not depend on the choice of origin. It would seem that the center of mass would be a natural origin, but is it necessary to make $\Vector{X}_{CM}$ the origin?
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a little theorem that clarifies this matter. We start by investigating how the total angular momentum would change if we change the origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The total angular momentum $\Vector{L}_A$ of the system of particles about a point $A$ with displacement $\Vector{a}$ from the origin is
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray*}
      \Vector{L}_{A}
      &amp; = &amp;
      \sum_{i} (\Vector{r}_{i} - \Vector{a}) \times \Vector{p}_{i} \\ 
      &amp; = &amp;
      \sum_{i} \Vector{r}_{i} \times \Vector{p}_{i} - \sum_{i} \Vector{a} \times \Vector{p}_{i} \\
      &amp; = &amp;
      \Vector{L} - \Vector{a} \times \sum_{i} \Vector{p}_{i} \\
      &amp; = &amp;
      \Vector{L} - \Vector{a} \times \Vector{P} \\
      \end{eqnarray*}
      $
    </p>
    <p class="theorem">
      We now observe that if the total momentum is zero, $\Vector{P} = 0$, then the total angular momentum is independent of where we choose the origin. Equivalently, if the center of mass is not moving, or we are in the center of mass frame, the total angular momentum is independent of where we choose the origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The total angular momentum also does not change if $\Vector{a}$ is parallel to $\Vector{P}$.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, if we set $\Vector{a}$ to $\Vector{X}_{CM}$ then rearrange we get
    </p>
    <p class="todo">
      I don't think this is the correct definition of the spin angular momentum. The reason is that the momenta are relative to the origin rather than the center-of-mass. See the derivation for Rigid Bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \Vector{L} = \Vector{L}_{CM} + (\Vector{X}_{CM} \times \Vector{P})
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p class="theorem">
      The total angular momentum of a system about any origin decomposes into a <b>spin</b> contribution $\Vector{L}_{CM}$ due to the motion of the particles relative to the center of mass, and to an <b>orbital</b> contribution, $\Vector{X}_{CM} \times \Vector{P}$, due to the motion of the center of mass 'particle' relative to the origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under special conditions, we will see that these contributions are independently conserved.

    <h3>Rate of change of Total Angular Momentum about an arbitrary fixed point</h3>

      $
      \begin{eqnarray*}
        \frac{d}{dt} \Vector{L}_{A}
        &amp; = &amp;
        \frac{d}{dt} \sum_{i} (\Vector{r}_{i} - \Vector{a}) \wedge \Vector{p}_{i} \\ 
        &amp; = &amp;
        \sum_{i} (\Vector{v}_{i} - \frac{d}{dt} \Vector{a}) \wedge \Vector{p}_{i} + \sum_{i} (\Vector{r}_{i} - \Vector{a}) \wedge \frac{d}{dt} \Vector{p}_{i} \\

        \sum_{i} \Vector{N}_{i, A}
      \end{eqnarray*}
      $

      The rate of change of the total angular momentum of a system of particles about a fixed point is equal to the sum of the torques about that point.

    <h3>Kinetic Energy of a Multiparticle System</h3>
    <p>
      The <b>total kinetic energy</b>, $K$, is defined to be the sum of the kinetic energy of all the particles.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      K &amp; = &amp; \sum_i \frac{1}{2} m_i (\Vector{v}_i)^2
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      The kinetic energy measured in the center of mass frame, $K_{CM}$, is then
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      K_{CM}
      &amp; = &amp;
      \sum_i \frac{1}{2} m_i (\Vector{v}_i - \Vector{V}_{CM})^2 \\
      &amp; = &amp;
      K - \Vector{V}_{CM} \cdot \sum_i m_i \Vector{v}_i + \frac{1}{2} \sum_i m_i \Vector{V}_{CM}^2 \\
      &amp; = &amp;
      K - \frac{1}{2} M \Vector{V}_{CM}^2 \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar to the total angular momentum, the total kinetic energy decomposes.
    </p>
    <p>

      \begin{eqnarray}
      K
      &amp; = &amp;
