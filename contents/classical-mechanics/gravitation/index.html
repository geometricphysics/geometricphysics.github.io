<h3>Isaac Newton and Gravitation</h3>

<p>Isaac Newton was prompted to produce a mathematical description for planetary motion by Robert Hooke. Hooke suggested that planets may effectively perform elliptic orbits if their motion was a combination of straight tangential motion together with a falling towards the sun. Hooke was unable to complete the mathematical steps required. Newton accounted for Kepler's Laws with his "Universal" Law of Gravitation.</p>

    <p>The Law of Gravitation is said to be "Universal" because every massive particle is affected by the force and every massive particle creates a force around it.</p>

      Newton's equations describing the gravitation field and how massive bodies respond to that field works well in many cases, but there are some real discrepancies and some consistency problems...
