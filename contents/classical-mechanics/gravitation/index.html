    <p>Isaac Newton was prompted to produce a mathematical description for planetary motion by Robert Hooke. Hooke suggested that planets may effectively perform elliptic orbits if their motion was a combination of straight tangential motion together with a falling towards the sun. Hooke was unable to complete the mathematical steps required. Newton accounted for Kepler's Laws with his Universal Law of Gravitation.</p>

<h3>Deriving the Universal Law of Gravitation from Kepler's observations</h3>

    <h3 class="panel-title">Direction of the Gravitational Force</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>We show that Kepler's Second Law is obeyed if the force on the planet is directed towards the sun.</p>
    <p>Let $\vec{r}$ be the displacement of the planet from the sun.</p>
    <p>Suppose that the planet moves a small amount $\Delta \vec{r}$ in a time interval $\Delta t$.</p>
    <p>Then the planet approximately sweeps out an area $\Delta A = \frac{1}{2} \vec{r} \wedge \Delta \vec{r}$ in time $\Delta t.$</p>
    <p>Hence, $\Delta A / \Delta t = \frac{1}{2} \vec{r} \wedge \bar{v}$, where $\bar{v} = \Delta \vec{r} / \Delta t$ is the average velocity in the time interval $\Delta t$.</p>
    <p>If we shrink the time interval $\Delta t$ we get $d A / d t = \frac{1}{2} \vec{r} \wedge \vec{v}$, for the rate of change of the area.</p>
    <p>If the planet has mass $m$ and linear momentum $\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$, then the rate of change of area is</p>
    <p>$dA / dt = \frac{1}{2m} L$, where $L = \vec{r} \wedge \vec{p}$ is the angular momentum of the planet about the sun.</p>
    <p>So if we assume that the mass of the planet is constant, Kepler's Second Law is equivalent to the statement $dL / dt = 0$; the rate of change of angular momentum is zero, or the angular momentum is conserved in time.</p>
    <p>But</p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        0 &amp; = &amp; dL / dt \\
          &amp; = &amp; d (\vec{r} \wedge \vec{p}) / dt \\
          &amp; = &amp; \vec{v} \wedge \vec{p} + \vec{r} \wedge \vec{F} \\
          &amp; = &amp; \vec{r} \wedge \vec{F}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>, where $\vec{F}$ is the force acting on the planet.</p>
    <p>It follows from the properties of the wedge product that $\vec{F}$ must be a scalar multiple of $\vec{r}$.</p>
    <p>The acceleration of the planet is in the direction of the force and is towards the sun. $\blacksquare$</p>

  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>Kepler's Third Law is obeyed if the strength of the force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the particles.</p>
    <p>We can easily derive the $1 / R^{2}$ dependence of Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation in the case of circular orbits (treating the elliptical case requires a bit more mathematical machinary).</p>
    <p>Kepler's Third Law, written mathematically is<br/><br/>
      $T^{2} = k(M) R^{3}$,<br/><br/>
      where $T$ is the period and $R$ is the radius, and $k$ is a function that may depend on the mass of the central body, but certainly does not depend on the radius.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key to finding the form of the force law is that the force, $f$ that keeps the planet traveling in a circle must be equal to the mass, $m$, of the planet times its acceleration $v^{2} / R$. Therefore,<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        f &amp; = &amp; m v^{2} / R \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we know that the speed $v$ is related to the radius $R$ by $vT = \tau R$, where $\tau$ is one turn or $2 \pi$.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression for f now becomes<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        f &amp; = &amp; m (\tau R)^{2} / R T^{2} \\
          &amp; = &amp; m \tau^{2} R / T^{2} \\
          &amp; = &amp; m \tau^{2} R / k(M) R^{3} \\
          &amp; = &amp; m \tau^{2} / k(M) R^{2} \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $.
    </p>
    <p>
      By symmetry and Newton's 3rd Law, if $f$ depends on the mass of the planet, $m$, then it must also depend in the same way on the mass of the central body, $M$.<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        f &amp; = &amp; \frac{G m M}{R^{2}}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $.
    </p>
    <p>The Law of Gravitation is said to be "Universal" because every massive particle is affected by the force and every massive particle creates a force around it.</p>

    <h3 class="panel-title">The gravitational attraction due to body</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>
      So far we have been using Newton's Universal Law for Gravitation without worrying too much about the fact that it was derived as a formula for the force between two particles i.e. points. We might argue that this is a reasonable approximation if the points are so far apart that they may effectively be treated as points.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, we can do better. Newton became aware of this issue in the Principia and proved some useful theorems concerning uniform spherical bodies.
    </p>

<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading">
    <h3 class="panel-title">Theorem: The gravitational force outside and due to a uniform spherical shell is as if all the mass were concentrated at its center</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>
      Use Spherical Polar Coordinates $(r, \theta, \phi)$ to take advantage of the spherical symmetry in the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mass, $dM$, of an element of area, $dA$, of a spherical shell of radius $r$ with mass density $\sigma$ is<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        dM &amp; = &amp; \sigma dA \\
           &amp; = &amp; \sigma r^{2} sin \theta d\theta d\phi
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      The total mass of the shell is found by integrating the mass element over the entire sphere boundary:<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        M &amp; = &amp; \int_{\partial sphere} dM \\
           &amp; = &amp; \sigma r^{2} \int_{0}^{\tau/2}sin \theta d\theta \int_{0}^{\tau} d\phi \\
           &amp; = &amp; \sigma r^{2} [-cos \theta]_{0}^{\tau/2} [\phi]_{0}^{\tau} \\
           &amp; = &amp; \sigma \, 2 \, \tau \, r^{2}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Now consider a mass $m$ placed on the z-axis at $R \hat{z}$, with $R > r$. The mass element $dM$ will exert a force on the mass $m$ and by symmetry all components in the $xy$ plane will cancel. The increment of force remaining on the particle is<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        d\mathbf{F} &amp; = &amp; - \frac{G m dM}{s^{2}} \mathbf{\hat{z}} \\
                    &amp; = &amp; - \frac{G m M cos \alpha sin \theta d\theta d\phi}{2 \tau s^{2}} \mathbf{\hat{z}} \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $<br/><br/>
      where $s$ is the separation between the partcle and the mass element, and $\alpha$ is the angle between the direction of the force increment and $\mathbf{\hat{z}}$.
    </p>
    <p>
      Integrate the increment of force over the shell to obtain the total force<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \mathbf{F} &amp; = &amp; - G m M \mathbf{\hat{z}} \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\frac{\tau}{2}} \frac{cos \alpha sin \theta d\theta}{s^{2}} \frac{1}{\tau} \int_{0}^{\tau} d\phi \\
                   &amp; = &amp; - G m M \mathbf{\hat{z}} \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\frac{\tau}{2}} \frac{cos \alpha sin \theta d\theta}{s^{2}} \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      We now proceed to evaluate the integral by using the geometry of the problem: $cos \alpha = (R - r cos \theta) / s$ and $s^{2} = R^{2} - 2 R r cos \theta + r^{2}$.<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \mathbf{F} &amp; = &amp; - G m M \mathbf{\hat{z}} \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\frac{\tau}{2}} \frac{(R - r cos \theta ) sin \theta d\theta}{(R^{2} - 2 R r cos \theta + r^{2})^{3/2}} \\
                   &amp; = &amp; - \frac{G m M}{R^{2}} \mathbf{\hat{z}} \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\frac{\tau}{2}} \frac{(1 - \mu cos \theta ) sin \theta d\theta}{(1 - 2 \mu cos \theta + \mu^{2})^{3/2}} \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
      <p>where $\mu = r / R$. Make the substitution $t^{2} = 1 - 2 \mu cos \theta + \mu^{2}$. Upon differentiating, $t dt = \mu sin \theta d \theta$. Some care is necessary in using the correct sign for the limits.<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \mathbf{F} &amp; = &amp; - \frac{G m M}{R^2} \mathbf{\hat{z}} \frac{1}{4} \int_{1 - \mu}^{1 + \mu} \frac{(t^{2} + 1 - \mu^{2}) dt}{\mu t^{2}} \\
                   &amp; = &amp; - \frac{G m M}{R^2} \mathbf{\hat{z}} \\

      The proof of this theorem is similar to the case of the mass being outside the sphere. However, it is necessary to split the integral for the force to account for the opposing directions.<br/><br/>
