    <p>Isaac Newton was prompted to produce a mathematical description for planetary motion by Robert Hooke. Hooke suggested that planets may effectively perform elliptic orbits if their motion was a combination of straight tangential motion together with a falling towards the sun. Hooke was unable to complete the mathematical steps required. Newton accounted for Kepler's Laws with his Universal Law of Gravitation.</p>

<h3>Deriving the Universal Law of Gravitation from Kepler's observations</h3>

    <h3 class="panel-title">Direction of the Gravitational Force</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>We show that Kepler's Second Law is obeyed if the force on the planet is directed towards the sun.</p>
    <p>Let $\vec{r}$ be the displacement of the planet from the sun.</p>
    <p>Suppose that the planet moves a small amount $\Delta \vec{r}$ in a time interval $\Delta t$.</p>
    <p>Then the planet approximately sweeps out an area $\Delta A = \frac{1}{2} \vec{r} \wedge \Delta \vec{r}$ in time $\Delta t.$</p>
    <p>Hence, $\Delta A / \Delta t = \frac{1}{2} \vec{r} \wedge \bar{v}$, where $\bar{v} = \Delta \vec{r} / \Delta t$ is the average velocity in the time interval $\Delta t$.</p>
    <p>If we shrink the time interval $\Delta t$ we get $d A / d t = \frac{1}{2} \vec{r} \wedge \vec{v}$, for the rate of change of the area.</p>
    <p>If the planet has mass $m$ and linear momentum $\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$, then the rate of change of area is</p>
    <p>$dA / dt = \frac{1}{2m} L$, where $L = \vec{r} \wedge \vec{p}$ is the angular momentum of the planet about the sun.</p>
    <p>So if we assume that the mass of the planet is constant, Kepler's Second Law is equivalent to the statement $dL / dt = 0$; the rate of change of angular momentum is zero, or the angular momentum is conserved in time.</p>
    <p>But</p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        0 &amp; = &amp; dL / dt \\
          &amp; = &amp; d (\vec{r} \wedge \vec{p}) / dt \\
          &amp; = &amp; \vec{v} \wedge \vec{p} + \vec{r} \wedge \vec{F} \\
          &amp; = &amp; \vec{r} \wedge \vec{F}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>, where $\vec{F}$ is the force acting on the planet.</p>
    <p>It follows from the properties of the wedge product that $\vec{F}$ must be a scalar multiple of $\vec{r}$.</p>
    <p>The acceleration of the planet is in the direction of the force and is towards the sun. $\blacksquare$</p>
