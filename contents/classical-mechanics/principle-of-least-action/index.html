    <h3>Systems of Particles</h3>
    <p>
      The positions of $N$ particles each with position vector $\vec{r}_{i}$ where $i = 1 \ldots N$, along with their velocities, $\vec{v}_{i}$, are used to specify the configuration of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The equations of motion that determine the evolution of the system are<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        m_{i} \frac{d \vec{v}_{i}}{d t} &amp; = &amp; \vec{F}_{i}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $<br/><br/>
      and<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \frac{d \vec{r}_{i}}{d t} &amp; = &amp; \vec{v}_{i}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that in this context, $i$ is an index that picks out a particular particle.
    </p>

    <h3>Configuration Space</h3>
    <p>
      Instead of labelling the system coordinates by particle index, we describe the configuration of the system as if it were a single particle with 3N position coordinates.
      The set $\{x_{i}\}$ defines a point in configuration space. Each point is a configuration of the system and the trajectory of the system is a curve. If there are N particles, each with 3 degrees of freedom then there are 3N coordinates to describe each point. Note that keeping track of the full configuration of the system also requres the set $\{ \dot{x}_{i} \}$. We will revisit this issue later when we describe phase space.
    </p>

    <h3>The Classical Action</h3>
    <p>
      Let $\bar{x}(t)$ be the trajectory of a macroscopic particle. We call this the <b>classical trajectory</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There exists a quantity $S[x]$, called the <b>action</b>, which can be computed for an arbitrary path, $x(t)$.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        S[x] &amp; = &amp; \int_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}} L(x(t), \dot{x}(t), t) dt
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      The function $L$, called the <b>lagrangian</b>, computes a value at each point along the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      With just this defintion, $L$ could be any function and the value of $S$ for a given path is therefore arbitrary. We need a principle to constrain $L$.
    </p>
    <p>
      We avoid defining $L$ as anything in particular, leaving the actual form of $L$ to be determined. Some authors define $L$ to be something and make the following principle a theorem.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Principle of Least (Stationary) Action</h3>
    <p>
      Along the classical path, $S$ an extremum with respect to a change in the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \delta S &amp; = &amp; S[\bar{x} + \delta x] - S[\bar{x}] = 0
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      We can now crank the handle to see what this means for $L$. The technique we use comes from the <b>Calculus of Variations</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose we try a path that differs a bit from the classical trajectory<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        x(t) &amp; = &amp; \bar{x}(t) + \alpha \eta(t)
      \end{eqnarray}
      $<br/><br/>
      where $\alpha$ is a scalar that controls how much we deviate from the classical trajectory $\bar{x}$. Along with the conditions that $\eta(t_{i}) = \eta(t_{f}) = 0$, we deduce that the lagrangian must satisfy a second order differential equations.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Euler Lagrange Equations</h3>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \frac{d}{d t} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x_{i}}} &amp; = &amp; \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{i}}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      We will later show that these equations also hold for a general coordinate transformation. This will be powerful because it extends the Lagrangian formalism to non-inertial frames and allows constraints to be handled more easily.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Computing the Lagrangian</h3>
    <p>
      The form of the lagrangian is usually <i>reverse engineered</i>. Knowing the actual equations of motion, we guess a lagrangian and see if it produces the correct force law.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a particle of mass $m$ subjected to a potential $V(x,t)$, the lagrangian is<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        L &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2} m \dot{x}^{2} - V(x,t)
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Universality of the Lagrangian formalism</h3>
    <p>
      All the fundamental laws of physics can be written using the action principle<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        L &amp; = &amp; \sqrt g (R - \frac{1}{2} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu} + \bar{\phi} \mathbb{D} \phi)
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Coordinate System Invariance</h3>
    <p>
      Consider the coordinate transformation<br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        q_{i} &amp; = &amp; q_{i}(x_{j}, t)
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this is a coordinate transformation we must have<br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        x_{j} &amp; = &amp; x_{j}(q_{i}, t)
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the properties of partial derivatives under coordinate transformations we can show<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \frac{d}{d t} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q_{i}}} &amp; = &amp; \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_{i}}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>

    <h3>Generalized Momentum Conjugate to $q_{i}$</h3>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        p_{i} &amp; = &amp; \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q_{i}}}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Mechanical momentum (mass times velocity) is elementary mechanics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Canonical momentum (derivative of Lagrangian wrt velocity) is advanced mechanics.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Cyclic Coordinates</h3>
    <p>
      Lagragian depends on velocity rather than a configuration coordinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lagragian is independent of some generalized configuration coordinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Conjugate Momentum is conserved</b>.
