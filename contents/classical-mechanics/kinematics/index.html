    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      We'll start with some informal definitions and making connections with physical quantities before applying more rigor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emphasis will be on identifying geometric objects that we can use in a geometric language to describe physical quantities that we encounter in science and engineering. This is in contrast to a more coordinate-based approach which ultimately leads to tensor analysis. A more complete geometric approach than is possible with only vector analysis will avoid some of the limitations and ambiguities of the Gibbs vector algebra and will generalize easily to more complex geometries.

    <h3>Operational Viewpoint and Measurement</h3>
    <p>
      Physics as a science of measurable quantities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Variables that appear in a theory should be defined in a way that they could be measured, at least conceptually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use of the words <b>mass</b>, <b>length</b>, and <b>time</b> implies that we understand how these quantities are to be measured.
    </p>

    <h3>Vectors as Geometrical Objects</h3>
    <p>
      There are interesting physical quantities that we encounter such as displacement, velocity, acceleration, force and momentum that require us to specify both their <b>magnitude and direction</b> in order to define them completely, and we call these <b>vector</b> quantities. This is a very informal, non-mathematical, definition that we will make more precise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose we want to describe a <b>point</b> in space using a vector. We can do the following:
      <p>Choose an arbitrary point in space and call it the <b>origin</b>, $O$.</p>
      <p>The point $A$ is then represented by the <b>position vector</b> $\Vector{a}$ (an arrow) from the origin $O$ to the point $A$.</p>
      <p>The vector $\Vector{a}$ has <b>magnitude</b>, <b>aspect</b> and <b>orientation</b>.
      <p>The <b>magnitude</b> of the vector is denoted by $\Norm{\Vector{a}}$ and can be though of geometrically as the length.
      <p>The <b>aspect</b> of the vector is the one-dimensional line that it lies on.
      <p>The <b>orientation</b> of the vector is $\pm 1$ according to whether the vector points in some standard orientation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A word about notation: Some texts will use bold face font <b>$\textbf{a}$</b> to represent vectors instead of just $a$. Of course, this is difficult to do in hand-written notes so students are often advised to use an arrow over the top of the symbol like this: $\vec{a}$. But we will be encountering other geometrical objects and so we will soon run out of notational tricks. My advice is to get used to working without the special accent notation and try to pick variable names that don't cause confusion.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Scalars as Geometrical Objects</h3>
    <p>
      There are also physical quantities that we think of as having only magnitude, and no direction, such as mass, speed, time and temperature. We call these <b>scalar</b> quantities. These often act as multipliers of vectors, scaling the vector by making it larger or smaller. Multiplying a vector by a non-zero positive scalar may change the magnitude of the vector but will not change its direction. However, multiplying a vector by a negative scalar will make the vector point in the opposite direction.
      <p>A scalar is still a geometric object because it has <b>magnitude</b>, <b>aspect</b> and <b>orientation</b>.
      <p>The <b>magnitude</b> of the scalar is denoted by $|a|$ and is the usual modulus (positive value) function.
      <p>The <b>aspect</b> of the scalar is the zero-dimensional point.
      <p>The <b>orientation</b> of the scalar is $\pm 1$ according to whether the scalar is positive or negative.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Other Geometrical Objects</h3>
    <p>
      We will encounter other geometrical objects besides scalars and vectors and will build up a powerful mathematical language based upon the simple operations of addition and multiplication.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>3-dimensional Cartesian Coordinate Frame</h3>
    <p>
      <p>Choose a set of three <b>orthonormal</b> vectors $\{\Vector{i},\Vector{j},\Vector{k}\}$ called the <b>basis</b>.</p>
      <p>Decompose a vector $\Vector{r}$ into its <b>projections</b> onto each of the basis vectors.</p>
      <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \Vector{a} &amp; = &amp; x \Vector{i} + y \Vector{j} + z \Vector{k} \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
      </p>
      <p>
        The quantities $x$, $y$, and $z$ are known as the <b>cartesian components</b> of the vector $\Vector{a}$ or the <b>coordinates</b> of $\Vector{a}$ in the cartesian or standard basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        An important point is that $a$ is the geometrical object (the arrow), whereas the coordinates depend upon the basis vectors.
      </p>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Notation: Coordinates and Standard Basis Vectors</h3>
    <p>
      We will use the notation $\{\Vector{i},\Vector{j},\Vector{k}\}$ as the basis for 3-dimensional Cartesian space for the time being and $x$, $y$, and $z$ as the corresponding coordinates.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, at times it will be more convenient to use a <b>tensor</b> notation for the coordinates and an index notation for the basis:
    </p>
      <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \Vector{a} &amp; = &amp; x^1 \Vector{e}_1 + x^2 \Vector{e}_2 + x^3 \Vector{e}_3 \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
      </p>

    <h3>Vector Algebra</h3>
    <p>
      Before looking at Geometric Algebra. We should do a review of Vector (Linear) Spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Vectors in Cartesian Coordinates</li>
        <li>Vector / Linear Spaces, Scalars</li>
        <li>Basis Vectors</li>
        <li>Components and Linear Combinations</li>
        <li>Magnitude and Pythagorean Theorem</li>
        <li>Component Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication</li>
        <li>Dot Product</li>
        <li>Cross Product</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Particle Motion</h3>
    <p>
      Suppose the <b>trajectory</b> (path) of a particle is described by a vector-valued function $\Vector{r}(t)$:
    </p>
    <p>
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
      \Vector{r}(t) &amp; = &amp; x(t) \Vector{i} + y(t) \Vector{j} + z(t) \Vector{k} \\
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
    <p>
      We see that the position is given by 3 functions of time and a basis. The goal of Classical Mechanics is to determine $\Vector{r}(t)$ given an <b>initial configuration</b> and a <b>dynamical law</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll need some more terminology to describe the kinematics before we get to the dynamics.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Displacement</h3>
    <p>
      The <b>displacement</b> (vector) of a particle is the vector from the particle's initial position to the final position.
    </p>
    <p>
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
      \Delta \Vector{r} &amp; = &amp; \Vector{r}_f - \Vector{r}_i = \Vector{r}(t_f) - \Vector{r}(t_i)
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
    <p>
      It's not necessary that the particle travelled in a straight line!
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Average Speed</h3>
    <p>
      The <b>average speed</b> is the ratio of the total distance travelled to the time taken.
    </p>
    <p>
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
      average \, speed =  \frac{total \, distance}{time \, taken}
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Average Velocity</h3>
    <p>
      The <b>average velocity</b> is the ratio of the displacement to the time interval.
    </p>
    <p>
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
      average \, velocity = \bar{\Vector{v}} =   \frac{displacement}{time \, interval} = \frac{\Delta \Vector{r}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Vector{r}_f - \Vector{r}_i}{t_f - t_i}
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
    <p>
      The slope of a position-time graph is $\Delta \Vector{r} / \Delta t$, which is the average velocity.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Velocity</h3>
    <p>
      The (instantaneous) <b>velocity</b> (vector) of a particle is defined using calculus as a limit of the average velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
      \Vector{v}(t) =  \frac{d \Vector{r}}{dt} = \dot{\Vector{r}} = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Vector{r}(t + \Delta t) - \Vector{r}(t)}{\Delta t}
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
    <p>
      $\Vector{v}$ is a vector-valued function (of a scalar argument), so this is really multiple equations, one for each dimension of space! However, the calculus isn't any more complex than the 1-dimensional case. When we write $\Vector{v}$ in cartesian components we have $\Vector{v}(t) = v_x(t) \Vector{i} + v_y(t) \Vector{j} + v_z(t) \Vector{k}$, where
    </p>
    <p>
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
      v_x(t) =  \frac{d x}{dt} = \dot{x} = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{x(t + \Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t}
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
    <p>
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
      v_y(t) =  \frac{d y}{dt} = \dot{y} = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{y(t + \Delta t) - y(t)}{\Delta t}
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
    <p>
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
      v_z(t) =  \frac{d z}{dt} = \dot{z} = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{z(t + \Delta t) - z(t)}{\Delta t}
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Speed</h3>
    <p>
      The speed of a particle is the magnitude of the velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
      \Norm{\Vector{v}(t)} =  \sqrt{(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)}
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Average Acceleration</h3>
    <p>
      The <b>average acceleration</b> is the ratio of the change in velocity to the time interval.
    </p>
    <p>
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
      average \, acceleration = \bar{\Vector{a}} =   \frac{change \, in \, velocty}{time \, interval} = \frac{\Delta \Vector{v}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Vector{v}_f - \Vector{v}_i}{t_f - t_i}
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
    <p>
      The slope of a velocity-time graph is $\Delta \Vector{v} / \Delta t$, which is the average acceleration.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Acceleration</h3>
    <p>
      The (instantaneous) <b>acceleration</b> (vector) of a particle is defined using calculus.
    </p>
    <p>
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
      \Vector{a}(t) =  \frac{d \Vector{v}}{dt} = \dot{\Vector{v}} = \ddot{\Vector{r}} = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Vector{v}(t + \Delta t) - \Vector{v}(t)}{\Delta t}
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>

    <h3>Uniform Circular Motion</h3>
    <p>
      Suppose we have a particle moving in a plane. We could use Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$ and corrsponding time $t$, to record the motion of the particle.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, because we are considering circular motion, we will find it sometimes more convenient to use polar coordinates in which a point is specified by its distance $r$ from a fixed point and by the angle $\theta$ from a fixed direction. So the polar coordinates are $(r, \theta)$.
    </p>
    <p class="definition">
      The <span class="definition"><b>period</b> is the time taken to complete one revolution</span>, normally given the symbol $T$.
    </p>
    <p class="definition">
      The <b>frequency</b> is the number of revolutions completed per unit time, normally given the symbol $f$.
    </p>
    <p>
      The period and frequency are related because for any amount of time $t$, $f t = t / T$, so by cancelling $t$,
    </p>
    <p class="important">
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
    f &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{T}
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
    <span class="definition">
      <p>
        By <b>circular motion</b>, we mean that the <em>distance of the particle</em>, $R$, from the origin is constant in time so
      </p>
      <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      r(t) &amp; = &amp; R
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
      </p>
      <p>
        and by <b>uniform</b> circular motion, we mean that the angle that the particles position vector makes with the reference direction increases uniformly in time, so
      </p>
      <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \theta(t) &amp; = &amp; \omega t + \phi
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
      </p>
    </span>
    <p>
      The constant $\phi$ is simply the angle that the particle makes at $t=0$
    </p>
    <p>
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
    \phi &amp; = &amp; \theta(0) = \theta_{0}
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
    <p>
      The constant $\omega$ can be related to the period $T$ or the frequency $f$ because
    </p>
    <p>
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
    \theta(t + n T) &amp; = &amp; \theta(t) + n (2 \pi)
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence
    </p>
    <p>
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
    \omega (t + n T) + \phi &amp; = &amp; \omega t + \phi + n (2 \pi)
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
    <p>
      and so
    </p>
    <p>
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
    T &amp; = &amp; \frac{2 \pi}{\omega}
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
    <p>
      The constant <span class="important">$\omega$ is called the <b>angular frequency</b></span> because
    </p>
    <p class="important">
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
    \omega &amp; = &amp; 2 \pi f = \frac{2 \pi}{T}
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="important"><b>speed</b> of the partice, $v$</span> can be realted to the radius $R$ and the angular frequency $\omega$. Consider a particle that travels an arc length $s$ in time $t$. The speed is, by definition
    </p>
    <p>
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
    v &amp; = &amp; \frac{s}{t}
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
    <p>
      But
    </p>
    <p>
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
    \frac{s}{R} &amp; = &amp; \theta(t_0 + t) - \theta(t_0) = \omega t
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence
    </p>
    <p class="important">
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
    v &amp; = &amp; R \omega
    \label{speed}
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
    <p>
      The instantaneous velocity of the particle $\Vector{v}$ is always perpendicular to its position vector $\Vector{r}$ and leads by one quarter of a turn, $(\tau / 4)$ or $(\pi / 2)$. The magnitude of the velocity is $\omega$ times the magnitude of the position vector. Since the velocity is the rate of change of position, and the acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, it follows that the acceleration leads the velocity by one quarter of a turn. The acceleration must then lead the position vector by one half a turn, i.e., the acceleration is always directed towards the center and is perpendicular to the velocity. The magnitude of the acceleration will be $\omega$ times the magnitude of the velocity, $a = R \omega^2$.
    </p>
    <p class="important">
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
    \Vector{a} &amp; = &amp; - \omega^2 \Vector{r}
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: By writing $\Vector{r}(t) = R \UnitVector{r}(t)$ with $\Norm{\UnitVector{r}(t)} = 1$ or $\Norm{\Vector{r}(t)} = R$, it is straightforward to show, using calculus, that the velocity is orthogonal to the position vector. But without introducing the assumption that the motion is taking place in a plane, it is not possible to go any further (consider e.g., a particle moving over the surface of a sphere). This would seem to be a good way to demonstrate the use of the vector (cross) product.
    </p>
    <p class="important">
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
    \Vector{v} &amp; = &amp; \Vector{\omega} \times \Vector{r}
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
    <p>
      Differentiating,
    </p>
    <p>
    $
    \begin{eqnarray}
    \Vector{a}
    &amp; = &amp;
    \frac{d \Vector{v}}{d t} \\
    &amp; = &amp;
    \frac{d \Vector{\omega}}{d t} \times \Vector{r} + \Vector{\omega} \times \frac{d \Vector{r}}{d t} \\
    &amp; = &amp;
    \Vector{0} \times \Vector{r} + \Vector{\omega} \times \Vector{v} \\
    &amp; = &amp;
    \Vector{\omega} \times (\Vector{\omega} \times \Vector{r}) \\
    &amp; = &amp;
    - \omega^2 \Vector{r} \\
    \end{eqnarray}
    $
    </p>
    <p>
      Cartesian coordinates also offer a non-geometric route to this result, but without the geometric expression for the velocity. That seems a nice way to contrast the geometric and coordinate approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even more powerful would be to use Geometric Algebra.
