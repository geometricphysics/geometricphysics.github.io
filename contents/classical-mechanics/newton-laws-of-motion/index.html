<h3>Newton's Laws of Motion</h3>

<p>Isaac Newton's <em>Principia</em>, containing his three Laws of Motion, was first published in 1687. It is a study of the concept of force and the resulting motions. The full, translated title is the <em>Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy</em>.</p>

    <p>
      A particle will remain in a state of rest or will continue travelling at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.</p>

    <p>
      The Principle of Inertia was first stated by Galileo Galilei, but for objects travelling along the surface of the earth, and therefore slightly curved paths. Newton's refinement was to say that the uniform motion is rectilinear - moving in a straight line.</p>

    <p>
      If an unbalanced force acts on a particle, it will cause the partcle to accelerate in the direction of the unbalanced force. The acceleration of the particle will be directly proportional to the unbalanced force and inversely proportional to the particle mass.</p>

    <p>
      If a particle A exerts a force on particle B, then particle B exerts a force equal in magnitude on body A, but in the opposite direction.</p>

    <p>
      The third law has been refined since Newton's time to have a <em>weak</em> and a <em>strong</em> form. In the strong form, the lines of the forces coincide along a line joining the particles rather than being merely parallel and opposite. The gravitational force between massive particles and the electrostatic forces between charges are examples of a forces obeying the strong form.</p>
