<h3>Newton's Laws of Motion</h3>

<p>Isaac Newton's <em>Principia</em>, containing his three Laws of Motion, was first published in 1687. It is a study of the concept of force and the resulting motions. The full, translated title is the <em>Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy</em>.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>
      A particle will remain in a state of rest or will continue travelling at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.</p>

    <p>
      The Principle of Inertia was first stated by Galileo Galilei, but for objects travelling along the surface of the earth, and therefore slightly curved paths. Newton's refinement was to say that the uniform motion is rectilinear - moving in a straight line.</p>

    <p>
      If an unbalanced force acts on a particle, it will cause the partcle to accelerate in the direction of the unbalanced force. The acceleration of the particle will be directly proportional to the unbalanced force and inversely proportional to the particle mass.</p>

      If a particle A exerts a force on particle B, then particle B exerts a force equal in magnitude on body A, but in the opposite direction.</p>

    <p>
      The third law has been refined since Newton's time to have a <em>weak</em> and a <em>strong</em> form. In the strong form, the lines of the forces coincide along a line joining the particles rather than being merely parallel and opposite. The gravitational force between massive particles and the electrostatic forces between charges are examples of a forces obeying the strong form.</p>

    <h3>Trains of Mass</h3>
    <p>
      A common problem (in tests) is that of masses connected together by a string. One mass, on the end of the train is then subjected to a force. This is sometimes disguised, or made apparently more complex, by using a pulley and gravity to generate the force on the terminal mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solving this system to compute the tension in the string is fairly simple but takes enough lines of algebra to make the problem a pain in tests. The result, at least for two masses, exhibits a high degree of symmetry in the masses. Is there some other way to think about this problem?
    </p>
    <p>
      We first consider the case of two masses. $m_1$ is subjected to a force $F$ and is connected to $m_2$ by a string. The tension in the string is $T$.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of the string, because it is non-stretchy, is to constrain the accelerations
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      a_1 &amp; = &amp; a_2
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      We now apply Newton's second law to each of the masses
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      m_2 a_2 &amp; = &amp; T
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      m_1 a_1 &amp; = &amp; F - T
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliminate the accelerations to solve for T
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      m_1 (\frac{T}{m_2}) &amp; = &amp; F - T
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      T &amp; = &amp; \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} F
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      The result is only symmetrical in the masses if $F = m_1 g$.
    </p>
    <p>
      We would expect that the total mass of the system, $M$, would come into play because the common acceleration, $a$, is governed only by the external force and the total mass
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      a &amp; = &amp; \frac{F}{M}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      This provides a quick route to the tension $T$ because $T = m_2 a$, as we have found previously.
