    <h3>Historical Development</h3>
    <p>
      Force per unit length between two parallel conducting wires is determined empirically to depend upon the currens in the wires and their separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      F / length &amp; = &amp; \frac{\mu_0 I_1 I_2}{2 \pi r}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \mu_0 &amp; = &amp; 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} N / A^2
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Experiments involving a compass and a wire suggest a picture of circles of magnetic field surrounding a current-carrying wire and yet the magnetic force is perpendicular to the lines of $\Vector{B}$. Of course, a vectoral field is not the only possibility (bivector is more appropriate).
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering an infinitesimally small length of wire $d\Vector{x}$, and accounting for the directions of the wire and magnetic field, the force is given by
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      d \Vector{F}_{magnetic} &amp; = &amp; I \, d \Vector{x} \times \Vector{B}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      A microscopic analysis of a current as a stream of charged particles suggests a magnetic force law for a moving charge and the introduction of a magnetic field $\Vector{B}$.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider a wire of cross-sectional area $A$ containing a current with drift velocity $\Vector{v}$ of charge carriers of density $n$ per unit volume and individual charge $q$.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      I &amp; = &amp; n A v q
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      We deduce the magnetic force per charge to be
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \Vector{F}_{magnetic} &amp; = &amp; q (\Vector{v} \times \Vector{B}) \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Studies of various geometries of currents leads to a guess (Biot-Savart Law) for the connection between the magnetic field $\Vector{B}$ and the source current densities $\Vector{j}(\Vector{r})$.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \Vector{B}(\Vector{r})
      &amp; = &amp;
      \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \int_{V} d^3\Primed{x} \frac{\Vector{j}(\Primed{\Vector{r}}) \times (\Vector{r} - \Primed{\Vector{r}})}{\Norm{\Vector{r} - \Primed{\Vector{r}}}^3}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      The Biot Savart guess reproduces the observed static magnetic fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      A consequence is that the magnetic field is divergence-free $\nabla \cdot \Vector{B} = 0$. In other words, there are no magnetic charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also get Amp&#232;res Law
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \oint_{C} d \Vector{x} \cdot \Vector{B} = \mu_0 I_{enclosed}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      We can combine this with Stokes's theorem to obtain the differential form of Amp&#232;res Law (incomplete, as Maxwell observed, because it does not respect charge conservation).
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \nabla \times \Vector{B} &amp; = &amp; \mu_0 \Vector{j}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $

    <h3>Lorentz Force Law</h3>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \Vector{F} &amp; = &amp; q (\Vector{E} + \Vector{v} \times \Vector{B}) \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
      where
      <ul>
        <li>$q$ is the charge of the particle</li>
        <li>$\Vector{v}$ is the velocity of the particle</li>
        <li>$\Vector{E}$ is the electric field</li>
        <li>$\Vector{B}$ is the magnetic field</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Magnetic forces alone cannot change the speed of a charged particle, they can only change the direction of motion.</p>

    <h3>Magnetic Field Units</h3>
    <p>
      The SI unit for the magnetic field is the <em>tesla</em> (abbreviated $T$) which is one newton per ampere-meter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another common unit is the <em>gauss</em> (abbreviated $G$) ($1 G = 10^{-4} T$).

    <h3>Magnetic Force on a Current-Carrying Wire</h3>
    <p>
      As a consequence of the Lorentz Force Law and since $I = A v \rho = \lambda v$,<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        F &amp; = &amp; \lambda l v B sin \theta \\
        F &amp; = &amp; B \, I \, l \, sin \theta \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
      where
      <ul>
        <li>$l$ is the length of the wire</li>
        <li>$I$ is the current in the wire</li>
        <li>$B$ is the magnetic field</li>
        <li>$\theta$ is angle between $\Vector{B}$ and the wire</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Magnetic Field due to a Current-Carrying Wire</h3>
    <p>
      Moving charges are the sources of magnetic fields.<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        B &amp; = &amp; \frac{\mu_{0} I}{2 \pi r} \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
      where
      <ul>
        <li>$\mu_{0}$ is permeability of free space ($4 \pi \times 10^{-7} N \cdot A^{2}$ or $4 \pi \times 10^{-7} T \cdot m / A$)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Grab the wire with the right hand and with the thumb in the direction of the conventional current. Fingers give the direction of the magnetic field.

    <h3>Mass Spectrometer</h3>
    <p>
      A source of ions are accelerated from rest by a voltage $V$. The ions enter a region of uniform magnetic field perpendicular to their velocity. The ions execute a semi-circular path and their position of impact is recorded on photographic plates. Positively charged ions are called cations. Negatively charged ions are called anions.<br/><br/>
