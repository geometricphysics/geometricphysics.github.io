    <h3>Lorentz Force Law</h3>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \Vector{F} &amp; = &amp; q (\Vector{E} + \Vector{v} \times \Vector{B}) \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
      where
      <ul>
        <li>$q$ is the charge of the particle</li>
        <li>$\Vector{v}$ is the velocity of the particle</li>
        <li>$\Vector{E}$ is the electric field</li>
        <li>$\Vector{B}$ is the magnetic field</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Magnetic forces alone cannot change the speed of a charged particle, they can only change the direction of motion.</p>

    <h3>Magnetic Field Units</h3>
    <p>
      The SI unit for the magnetic field is the <em>tesla</em> (abbreviated $T$) which is one newton per ampere-meter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another common unit is the <em>gauss</em> (abbreviated $G$) ($1 G = 10^{-4} T$).

    <h3>Magnetic Force on a Current-Carrying Wire</h3>
    <p>
      As a consequence of the Lorentz Force Law and since $I = A v \rho = \lambda v$,<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        F &amp; = &amp; \lambda l v B sin \theta \\
        F &amp; = &amp; B \, I \, l \, sin \theta \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
      where
      <ul>
        <li>$l$ is the length of the wire</li>
        <li>$I$ is the current in the wire</li>
        <li>$B$ is the magnetic field</li>
        <li>$\theta$ is angle between $\Vector{B}$ and the wire</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Magnetic Field due to a Current-Carrying Wire</h3>
    <p>
      Moving charges are the sources of magnetic fields.<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        B &amp; = &amp; \frac{\mu_{0} I}{2 \pi r} \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
      where
      <ul>
        <li>$\mu_{0}$ is permeability of free space ($4 \pi \times 10^{-7} N \cdot A^{2}$ or $4 \pi \times 10^{-7} T \cdot m / A$)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Grab the wire with the right hand and with the thumb in the direction of the conventional current. Fingers give the direction of the magnetic field.

    <h3>Mass Spectrometer</h3>
    <p>
      A source of ions are accelerated from rest by a voltage $V$. The ions enter a region of uniform magnetic field perpendicular to their velocity. The ions execute a semi-circular path and their position of impact is recorded on photographic plates. Positively charged ions are called cations. Negatively charged ions are called anions.<br/><br/>
