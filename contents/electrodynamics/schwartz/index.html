    <h3>Four-Current</h3>
    <p>
      We want charge to be conserved. Let $\Vector{j(\Vector{x},t)}$ be the flux of charge per unit area and $\rho(\Vector{x},t)$ the charge density. The total charge $Q$ inside a volume $V$ is
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      Q(t) &amp; = &amp; \int_{V} d^3 x \, \rho(\Vector{x},t).
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      The charge flowing <em>into</em> the same volume through its boundary $\partial V$ with outward normal $\Vector{\hat{n}}$ per unit time is given by
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \frac{d Q}{d t} (t) &amp; = &amp; - \int_{\partial V} d^2 x \, (\Vector{j}(\Vector{x},t) \cdot \Vector{\hat{n}}).
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      Combining these two equations, applying Gauss's theorem, and considering an arbitrary volume, we get the continuity equation in differential form:
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      \nabla \cdot \Vector{j} + \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} &amp; = &amp; 0.
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that the divergence of a four-vector is a scalar, and so the four-current $J$ must be
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
      J &amp; = &amp; (\Vector{j}, \rho).
      \end{eqnarray}
      $

    <h3>Dynamics</h3>
    <p>
      We assume that the force experienced by a charged particle in its own rest frame is due to the electric field.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also must be careful to ensure that any analysis we do that uses what we know about electrostatics happens in an environment where the charge density and current are not changing with time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The derivation of Maxwell's equations proceeds by generalizing electrostatics into a Lorentz-covariant form. We start with Poisson's equation and infer the existence of a four-vector potential. We can solve the d'Alembertian equations to find retarded potentials for $\psi$ and $\Vector{A}$. In order to connect $\Vector{E}$ to $\Vector{A}$ we construct an antisymmetric second-rank tensor $F$ enabling us to generalize the expression for $\Vector{E}$. We define $\Vector{B} = \nabla \times \Vector{A}$. Extracting Maxwell's equations is then a matter of expansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      We find that to write Maxwell's equations in compact tensor form requires two equations and two antisymmetric tensors $F$ and $G$.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lorenz Force Law is also derivable by transforming the electrostatic force law from the rest frame of the charged particle to one where the particle is moving.
