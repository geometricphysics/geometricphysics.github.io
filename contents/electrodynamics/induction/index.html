    <h3>Magnetic Flux</h3>
    <p>
      The magnetic flux, $\Phi$, through an area A in a region of magnetic field B is<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \Phi &amp; = &amp; B \cdot A \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $<br/><br/>
    </p>

    <h3>Motional Electromotance</h3>
    <p>
      The motion of a wire through a magnetic field will cause the free electrons to move as a result of the Lorentz force. For an open wire, a charge distribution will build up which balances the Lorentz force.
    </p>
    <p>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        q E           &amp; = &amp; q v B \\
        \Rightarrow \varepsilon &amp; = &amp; B l v \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $<br/><br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now slide the wire along rails so that there is a closed circuit. A current will flow and the moving wire will experience a force $F = BIl$. An external agent most do work against this force to maintain the current.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that as the wire moves, the magnetic flux enclosed changes in a time $\Delta t$ by<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \Delta \Phi &amp; = &amp; l (v \Delta t) B \\
      \end{eqnarray}
      $<br/><br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \varepsilon &amp; = &amp; B l v \\
            &amp; = &amp; \frac{d \Phi}{d t}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $<br/><br/>
    </p>

    <h3>Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction</h3>
    <p>
      We find experimentaly that we can also induce an emf by changing the flux linked. The direction of the induced current is such as to oppose the change causing it (Lenz's Law)<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \varepsilon &amp; = &amp; - \frac{d \Phi}{d t}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
    </p>
    <p>
      The minus sign in this context is more symbolic than anything. However, in problems relating to inductance, Lenz's Law should be applied to determine the direction of the induced current. The magnitude of the current is<br/><br/>
      $
      \begin{eqnarray}
        I &amp; = &amp; \frac{\varepsilon}{R}
      \end{eqnarray}
      $
