  <h1>Numbers</h1>
  <section>
    <h3>Natural Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      $\{1,2,3,\ldots\}$
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Real Axis</h3>
    <p>
      We will assume the concept of a real number as represented by points on a line.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Point Set</h3>
    <p>
      A set of points (or real numbers) is called a <b>one-dimensional point set</b>.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Countability</h3>
    <p>
      A set is said to be <b>countable</b> if its elements can be placed in 1-1 correspondence with the natural numbers.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Variable</h3>
    <p>
      A symbol $x$ which can represent any number or point of a set is called a <b>variable</b>.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Constants</h3>
    <p>
      Fixed numbers on the real axis are called <b>constants</b>.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Interval</h3>
    <p>
      A set of points $x$ such that $a &le; x &le; b$ is called a <b>closed interval</b> and is denoted by $[a,b]$.
    </p>
    <p>
      $[a,b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: a &le; x &le; b \}$
    </p>
    <p>
      A set of points $x$ such that $a &lt; x &lt; b$ is called an <b>open interval</b> and is denoted by $(a,b)$.
    </p>
    <p>
      $(a,b) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: a &lt; x &lt; b \}$
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Neighborhood</h3>
    <p>
      The set of all points $x$ such that $|x-a| &lt; \delta$, where $\delta &gt; 0$ is called a <b>$\delta$ neighborhood of the point a</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The set of all points $x$ such that $0 &lt; |x-a| &lt; \delta$, where $\delta &gt; 0$ is called a <b>deleted $\delta$ neighborhood of the point a</b>.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Limit Point</h3>
    <p>
      A <b>limit point</b> of a set of numbers is a number $l$ such that every deleted $\delta$ neighborhood of $l$ contains members of the set.
    </p>
    <p>
      For any $\delta$, there exists $x &ne; l$ such that $|x - l| &lt; \delta$.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Closed Set</h3>
    <p>
      A set that contains all its limit points is called a <b>closed set</b>.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Bounds</h3>
    <p>
      If for all numbers $x$ of a set there exists a number $M$ such that $x &le; M$ then the set is <b>bounded above</b> and $M$ is called the <b>upper bound</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If for all numbers $x$ of a set there exists a number $m$ such that $x &ge; m$ then the set is <b>bounded below</b> and $m$ is called the <b>lower bound</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a set is bounded above and below, the set is <b>bounded</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If $M_{L}$ is an upper bound for set and there is at least one member which is greater than $M_{L}-\epsilon$ for every $\epsilon &gt; 0$ then $M_{L}$ is called the <b>least upper bound</b> of the set.
    </p>
    <p>
      If $m_{G}$ is a lower bound for set and there is at least one member which is less than $m_{L}+\epsilon$ for every $\epsilon &gt; 0$ then $m_{G}$ is called the <b>greatest lower bound</b> of the set.
    </p>

    <h3>Weierstrass-Bolzano Theorem</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Every bounded infinite set has at least one limit point</em>.
