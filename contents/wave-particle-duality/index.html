    <h3>Young's Double Slit Experiment</h3>
    <p>
      Low intensity limit. Discrete detection events. Quantized properties suggests Particle? But a wave can have quantized properties!

    <h3>Photoelectric Effect</h3>
    <p>
      This is the actual experiment that showed the quantized nature of the energy exchanged between light and matter.

    <h3>Compton Effect</h3>
    <p>
      Conservation of energy and momentum accounts for scattering of a photon off an electron.

      Unification of massless and massive particles. The associated wave. Prediction of electron diffraction.

    <h3>Wave Mechanics</h3>
    <p>
      Quantum Mechanics is essentially a theory of waves exhibiting interference and then subject to boundary conditions. It is the application of the boundary conditions that gives rise to quantization of properties. Although quantum mechanics is considered to be the appropriate theory for microscopic systems, quantum phenomena are manifest in systems where interference effects are not masked by the complexity of interactions with the environment. It is therefore more appropriate to think of quantum effects being observable when systems are sufficiently isolated.

    <h3>Path Integral Formalism</h3>
    <p>
      Feynman was clear that he felt the fundamental notion was a particle. However, Feymann clearly had in mind the Path Integral formulation of quantum mechanics as a way to compute amplitudes, and in turn, probabilities. Such a particle is certainly not classical. It is also clear that probabilities are calculated based upon interfering alternatives which corresponds to waves.

    <h3>Quantum Particle</h3>
    <p>
      The modern perspective is that quantum particles are excitations of fields. This is the mathematical idea behind quantum field theory. From this perspective, waves are more fundamental and quantum particles are wave packets resulting from quantizing fields.

    <h3>Classical Particle</h3>
    <p>
      A classical particle is one whose trajectory is determined by local interactions along its path.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distinction is made between a classical and quantum particle. Some modern theorists, who subscribe to the Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics or something equivalent, think of classical to mean an approximation in which a quantum object does not interfere with itself in other universes. This replaces the macroscopic versus microscopic distinction which is both problematic and misleading.
