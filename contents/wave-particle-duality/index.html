    <h3>Quantum Mechanics</h3>
    <p>
      Quantum Mechanics is essentially a theory of waves exhibiting interference and then subject to boundary conditions. It is the application of the boundary conditions that gives rise to quantization of properties. Although quantum mechanics is considered to be the appropriate theory for microscopic systems, quantum phenomena are manifest in systems where interference effects are not masked by the complexity of interactions with the environment. It is therefore more appropriate to think of quantum effects being observable when systems are sufficiently isolated.

    <h3>Modern Perspective of Quantum Field Theory</h3>
    <p>
      The modern perspective is that quantum particles are excitations of fields. This is the mathematical idea behind quantum field theory. From this perspective, waves are more fundamental and quantum particles are wave packets resulting from quantizing fields.

    <h3>Modern Perspective of String or M-Theory</h3>
    <p>
      String or M-theory is all about the quantum mechanics of relativistic vibrating strings or higher dimensional surfaces.

    <h3>Classical versus Quantum</h3>
    <p>
      The distinction is made between a classical and quantum particle. Some modern theorists who subscribe to the Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics, or something equivalent, think of classical to mean an approximation in which a quantum object does not interfere with itself in other universes. This replaces the macroscopic versus microscopic distinction which is both problematic and misleading.

    <h3>Path Integrals</h3>
    <p>
      Feynman was clear that he felt the fundamental notion was a particle. However, Feymann clearly had in mind the Path Integral formulation of quantum mechanics as a way to compute amplitudes, and in turn, probabilities. Such a particle is certainly not classical. It is also clear that probabilities are calculated based upon interfering alternatives which corresponds to waves.

    <h3>The Photoelectric effect</h3>
    <p>
      The most unambiguous statement that we can make about this experiment is that the energy exchanged between that which we call the electromagnetic field and electrons is quantized in a quantitative way according to the wavelength of the radiation. It is the quanta of energy that are called photons. We should be careful not to use our limited information about how localized the photon may be, coupled with an inadequate classical definition of a particle, to conclude a vague statement about the particular nature of photons. Better to understand the models of quantum particles that have emerged since, and place the effect in that context.
